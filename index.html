<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Last Days Madness: Obsession of the Modern Church</h2><p>Gary DeMar sheds light on the most difficult and studied prophetic passages, including Daniel 7:13-14; 9:24-27; Matt. 16:27-28; 24-25; Thess. 2; 2 Peter 3:3-13, and many more. DeMar identifies the Beast, the Antichrist, and the Man of Lawlessness and clears the haze regarding Armageddon, the abomination of desolation, the rebuilding of the temple, and the meaning of 666. This is the most thoroughly documented and comprehensive study of Bible prophecy ever written! LDM will be your survival guide and spiritual compass to insure you escape the paralysis of last days madness.</p><p>Gary DeMar grew up in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He is a graduate of Western Michigan University (1973) and earned his M.Div. at Reformed Theological Seminary in 1979. He has lived in the Atlanta area since 1979 with his wife Carol.

For 10 years he has been the editor of <i>Direction</i>, an International Journal on the Alexander Technique, and has led trainings and seminars all over the world.</p><h2>The Blood Libel Legend: A Casebook in Anti-Semitic Folklore</h2><p>Alan Dundes, in this casebook of an anti-Semitic legend, demonstrates the power of folklore to influence thought and history. According to the blood libel legend, Jews murdered Christian infants to obtain blood to make matzah. Dundes has gathered here the work of leading scholars who examine the varied sources and elaborations of the legend. Collectively, their essays constitute a forceful statement against this false accusation. The legend is traced from the murder of William of Norwich in 1144, one of the first reported cases of ritualized murder attributed to Jews, through nineteenth-century Egyptian reports, Spanish examples, Catholic periodicals, modern English instances, and twentieth-century American cases. The essays deal not only with historical cases and surveys of blood libel in different locales, but also with literary renditions of the legend, including the ballad &#34;Sir Hugh, or, the Jew&#39;s Daughter&#34; and Chaucer&#39;s &#34;The Prioress&#39;s Tale&#34;. These case studies provide a comprehensive view of the complex nature of the blood libel legend. The concluding section of the volume includes an analysis of the legend that focuses on Christian misunderstanding of the Jewish feast of Purim and the child abuse component of the legend and that attempts to bring psychoanalytic theory to bear on the content of the blood libel legend. The final essay by Alan Dundes takes a distinctly folkloristic approach, examining the legend as part of the belief system that Christians developed about Jews. This study of the blood libel legend will interest folklorists, scholars of Catholicism and Judaism, and many general readers, for it is both the literature and the history of anti-Semitism.</p><p>Alan Dundes is professor of anthropology and folklore at the University of California, Berkeley. His books published by the University of Wisconsin Press are: Parsing Through Customs: Essays by a Freudian Folklorist; Cinderella: A Casebook; and Little Red Riding Hood: A Casebook.Easter Saturday, 1144: a 12-year-old boy named William is found murdered in the woods outside Norwich, England. Several years later, Thomas of Monmouth, a monk, learns of William's death and becomes obsessed by it. He hears rumors that Jews crucified William in a bizarre ritual. A Jew converted to Catholicism named Theobald confides that Jews annually sacrifice a Christian child "to show contempt for Christ." Based on this and other hearsay, Thomas writes a re-creation of William's murder implicating Jews, and the blood libel is born. Dundes ( Cinderella: A Casebook ) collects 14 essays analyzing this tale and tracing its metastasis throughout Europe, the Middle East and the U.S. Manifesting itself in cultural contexts as different as Chaucer's "The Prioress's Tale," Spain during the Inquisition and Nazi Germany, the legend has had consistently deadly consequences. Several essays substantially repeat information; one, by Ernest A. Rappaport, is allusive to the point of distraction. Nevertheless, they make a fascinating detective story in which the culprit is the human desire for narrative itself when it serves the goals of racism. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Baseball&#39;s Knotty Problems (Sporting News Selects)</h2><p>Questions &amp; answers about baseball rules with examples from actual major league games-plus official rules of the game.</p><p></p><h2>Warcraft: Legends Volume 3</h2><p>Some of the world&#39;s best manga creators join together to bring the world of Warcraft to life as never before!</p><p></p><h2>Together We Were Eleven Foot Nine: The Twenty-Year Friendship of Hall of Fame Pitcher Jim Palmer and Orioles Manager Earl Weaver</h2><p>The story of the prickly friendship between Baltimore Orioles pitcher Jim Palmer and team manager Earl Weaver recalls their frequent bouts of shouting, threats, pouting, and more that marked their record-making professional relationship. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>Palmer and Weaver met in 1967, when the pitcher, who had put in two years with Baltimore and developed a sore arm, was sent to the Rochester farm club, where Weaver was managing. In 1969, Palmer was back with the Orioles and Weaver was named their manager. They remained together until 1982, when Weaver retired for the first time (he un-retired in 1985, but by then Palmer had gone). Superficially, they were vastly different: Palmer was cerebral, tall and handsome; Weaver was emotional, short and not so handsome. Yet they had their similarities: stubbornness and single-minded devotion to winning. They fought in the clubhouse, on the field, in the press, but their mutual will to win helped the Orioles be the most successful major-league team of the '70s. This is a fast-moving and witty account of those years. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Zugunruhe: The Inner Migration to Profound Environmental Change</h2><p>Just prior to periods of great migration, certain species display agitation and restlessness - a phenomenon referred to by scientists as <i>zugunruhe</i>.

Tour.</p><p>Bill Bamberger&#39;s work has been widely published and exhibited across the country. A recipient of the Lyndhurst Prize, he teaches at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and lives in Mebane, North Carolina. Cathy Davidson is the author and editor of over a dozen books and a recipient of numerous grants and fellowships. Past president of the American Studies Association, she is currently Ruth F. DeVarney Professor of English at Duke University. She lives in Durham, North Carolina....[a] handsome book ... The book isn't particularly scholarly; Davidson's writing, though sometimes affecting, is often quite simplistic, especially when it comes to economics. But the book offers an unusual glimpse into the lives of working-class Americans, and by providing a close study of one plant closing, it subtly debunks some trendy myths about deindustrialization.... -- <i><i>The Nation</i>, Kim Phillips-Fein</i><br><br>A beautifully composed elegy of words and images celebrating a vanishing way of life. These understated, evocative photographs by Bill Bamburger and this poetic text by Cathy N. Davidson ask, in effect, 'Does one have to sell one's soul in order to survive in contemporary America?' -- <i>Joyce Carol Oates</i><br><br>Blending thoughtful text and 98 photographs, "Closing" is the best kind of documentary--telling a specific story about specific people in a larger context that means something....In a better world, "closing" would be on the reading lists of every corporate board and business school. -- <i>USA Today</i><br><br>Cathy Davidson's writing is clear-sighted and intelligent and establishes why this is a national, indeed an international story. It is not artful prose; there is not a trace of existential angst to it, thank goodness. If only James Agee had written about the Alabama tenant farmers in the same way....And in all these photographs, there is a powerful intimacy with the photographer, the kind of intimacy only achieved by a person who has showed his seriousness, earned trust, staked out a life in common with the people he is portraying. This is "Closing's" real achievement: the making relevant of documentary art in daily life. -- <i>Brightleaf, Raleigh, NC, David Cecelski, December 1998</i><br><br>Eloquent and elegaic, Closing is a testament to the human spirit and to the dignity and importance of work. -- <i>Lee Smith</i><br><br>Here is a stupendous book, a complete answer to any who believe that all that counts in a company is its bottom line, and that the only people with a stake in it are its shareholders. -- <i>The Economist</i><br><br>If there are executives out there who are facing the seemingly inexorable logic of plant closings, they could do worse than to spend a few hours with this book. Not that it would necessarily change minds, but that it might help them walk into it with their eyes open. And if they haven't got time to read it, just looking at the photos will do. -- <i>Duke Magazine, Paul Baerman, November-December 1998</i><br><br>The photographs capture the shock, uncertainty and despair of what Davidson calls the 'human spirit... downsized.'... Bamberger preserves the spirit of its employees and their pride in their craft. Davidson's eloquent text describes, in concise, vivid detail, the stories of five employees who 'represent a cross section of the American work force.' An unflinchingly fair analysis. Hard-edged and realistic. "Closing"... issues a bold challenge to 'business as usual.' -- <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><h2>Alice In Wonderland</h2><p>A little girl falls down a rabbit hole and discovers a world of nonsensical and amusing characters.</p><p></p><h2>White Gulls and Wild Birds: Essays on C.S.

Countries explains maps and globes, landforms, and the Earth's rotation and evolution. Except for the map of Europe, the maps of continents have art objects, buildings, etc., superimposed on them, adding even more information visually. There's hardly any text in Plants?it's mostly captions. Plants are organized by continent, and children might be a bit confused by seeing species common to North America listed under another continent. There is no note saying that some plants are found in several parts of the world. The overlays in this title are particularly effective, often showing the interior of a plant or animals living inside it. In both volumes, when appropriate, a small map or globe is included on the page to place what's being discussed.

By the author of Back of the Box Gourmet. 50,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>Food fads may come and go, but many American households still have "meat loaf night" once a week. What a relief, then, to have this new book from McLaughlin ( Back of the Box Gourmet ), in which he assigns a different meat loaf for every week of the year. Granted, some of these versions seem fairly fancy for everyday fare: "Pretty Much Pate" calls for chicken livers, ground veal, garlic and leeks, while "Veal Cordon Bleu Roulade" gives "a little country club class to ordinary meat loaf" by tucking Swiss cheese and ham slices inside the loaf. McLaughlin, who understands secret yearnings for "Classic Interstate Meat Loaf" made with "ketchup in and ketchup on," is a Brooklyn-based author and food industry consultant. Some of the recipes appear to be fugitives from his earlier book, such as "Campbell's Meat Loaf Wellington" and "Kellogg's Spicy Tomato Mini-Loaves." No matter. The main point of baking a meat loaf is to make the most of what's in the pantry. Need proof? McLaughlin's "Dream Loaf," which he considers "the ultimate expression of the entire genre," is made with Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, crumbled saltine crackers, ketchup and bacon. Likewise, "Ann Landers's Good Advice Meat Loaf" is redolent with Accent and Lipton onion soup mix. Despite the cutesy asides and kitschy '50s illustrations, which poke fun at good old American food, McLaughlin really does know his meat loaf. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Nectar of Devotion: Complete Science of Bhakti Yoga</h2><p>The Bhagavad-gita is the main source-book on yoga and a concise summary of India&#39;s Vedic wisdom. Yet remarkably, the setting for this classic of spiritual literature is an ancient Indian battlefield. At the last moment, the great warrior Arjuna begins to wonder about the real meaning of his life. In the Bhagavadgita, Lord Krsna brings His disciple from perplexity to spiritual enlightenment. Bhagavad-gita As It Is is the largest-selling, most widely used edition of the Gita in the world.</p><p></p><h2>Phantom of the Music Room: A Musical for 2-Part Voices, Enhanced CD</h2><p>Who or what is that shadowy figure playing the piano in the school music room after dark?

Instead, she is simply presenting Zen principles and practices that emphasize living a life of grace and self-acceptance. Having faced the daily challenges of growing up black in America, she is especially adept at showing how these Zen principles apply to the African American experience. "People of color are especially in need of new ways and new answers to the separation and fear we face each day," Kyodo Williams writes. "It wouldn't be a stretch to say that as black people, more than most groups in this country, we live our daily lives with the distinct taste of fear in our mouths.... While the principles offered here are not an antidote to the underlying reasons for our fears, they can give us a different way to approach them."<p> Kyodo Williams offers a savvy yet tender voice as she walks readers through the basic principles of Zen. It's hard to resist her invitation to take on the numerous sensible vows that lead to enlightenment, such as staying true to the warrior spirit while "committing ourselves to practicing good." The bottom line is that this is a book about claiming the strength, compassion, and integrity that dwell within everyone. And although it speaks to the particular needs and trials of the African American community, readers of all colors and walks of life will find this an irresistible invitation. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Angel Kyodo Williams is an ordained Zen priest and founder of the Urban Peace Project.

Le Guin has won many Nebula and Hugo Awards, as well as a National Book Award, a Pushcart Prize, the Harold D. Vursell Memorial Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Newbery Honor and the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement.In her introduction to this reprint collection of eight of her more recent SF stories, Le Guin (Tehanu) defends the best work of the genre as "beautiful." It is critics and reviewers, she claims, who miss that beauty by emphasizing SF's role as an expositor of ideas. In any case, it's clear that the stories presented here show the softer side of the genre at its best. "The First Contact with the Gorgonids" and "The Ascent of the North Face," the two entries that Le Guin calls "funny stories, silly stories," are just that-witty, satirical and amusing. Yet it is the author's more serious work that displays her talents best, as she employs recurring themes and elements-cultural diversity, unlikely heroes and heroines, power's ability to corrupt, love's power to guide-and considers characters and types (women, children, the differently sexed and gendered) so often disenfranchised by other, more technologically oriented SF writers. From the briefest nonhumorous story here ("The Kerastion," about a silent flute made of human skin) to the longest, eponymous one, Le Guin ponders the nature of art and how life should be lived. Always, her stories are about people, not technologies, and it is this emphasis, as well as her accomplished prose, that makes this such a classy and valuable collection. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Meta Math!: The Quest for Omega</h2><p>Gregory Chaitin, one of the world&#x2019;s foremost mathematicians, leads us on a spellbinding journey, illuminating the process by which he arrived at his groundbreaking theory.<br><br>Chaitin&#x2019;s revolutionary discovery, the Omega number, is an exquisitely complex representation of unknowability in mathematics. His investigations shed light on what we can ultimately know about the universe and the very nature of life. In an infectious and enthusiastic narrative, Chaitin delineates the specific intellectual and intuitive steps he took toward the discovery. He takes us to the very frontiers of scientific thinking, and helps us to appreciate the art&#x2014;and the sheer beauty&#x2014;in the science of math.</p><p>Gregory Chaitin works at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Westchester County, New York, and is a visiting professor in the Computer Science Department of the University of Auckland, New Zealand. The author of eight previous books on mathematics, he lives in New York.In his book <i>Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity, </i>David Foster Wallace refers to G�del as &#x201c;modern math&#x2019;s absolute Prince of Darkness&#x201d; (p. 275) and states that because of him &#x201c;pure math&#x2019;s been in mid-air for the last 70 years&#x201d; (p. 284). In other words, according to Wallace, since G�del published his famous paper in 1931, mathematics has been suspended hanging in mid-air without anything like a proper foundation.<br><br> It is high time these dark thoughts were permanently laid to rest. Hilbert&#x2019;s century-old vision of a static completely mechanical absolutely rigorous formal mathematics was a misguided attempt intended to demonstrate the absolute certainty of mathematical reasoning. It is time for us to recover from this disease!<br><br> G�del&#x2019;s 1931 work on incompleteness, Turing&#x2019;s 1936 work on uncomputability, and my own work on the role of information, randomness and complexity have shown increasingly emphatically that the role that Hilbert envisioned for formalism in mathematics is best served by computer programming languages, which are in fact formalisms that can be mechanically interpreted&#x2014;but they are formalisms for computing and calculating, not for reasoning, not for proving theorems, and most emphatically not for inventing new mathematical concepts nor for making new mathematical discoveries.<br><br> In my opinion, the view that math provides absolute certainty and is static and perfect while physics is tentative and constantly evolving is a false dichotomy. Math is actually not that different from physics. Both are attempts of the human mind to organize, to make sense of, human experience; in the case of physics, experience in the laboratory, in the physical world; and in the case of math, experience in the computer, in the mental mindscape of pure mathematics.<br><br> And mathematics is far from static and perfect; it is constantly evolving, constantly changing, constantly morphing itself into new forms. New concepts are constantly transforming math and creating new fields, new viewpoints, new emphasis, and new questions to answer. And mathematicians do in fact utilize unproved new principles suggested by computational experience, just as a physicist would.<br><br> And in discovering and creating new mathematics, mathematicians do base themselves on intuition and inspiration, on unconscious motivations and impulses, and on their aesthetic sense, just like any creative artist would. And mathematicians do not lead logical mechanical &#x201c;rational&#x201d; lives. Like any creative artist, they are passionate emotional people who deeply care about their art, they are unconventional eccentrics motivated by mysterious forces, not by money nor by a concern for the &#x201c;practical applications&#x201d; of their work.<br><br> I know, because I&#x2019;m one of these crazy people myself! I&#x2019;ve been obsessed by these questions for my whole life, starting at an early age. And I&#x2019;ll give you an insider&#x2019;s view of all of this, a firsthand report from the front, where there is still a lot of fighting, a lot of pushing and shoving, between different viewpoints. In fact basic questions like this are never settled, never definitively put aside, they have a way of resurfacing, of popping up again in transformed form, every few generations . . .<br><br> So that&#x2019;s what this book is about: It&#x2019;s about reasoning questioning itself, and its limits and the role of creativity and intuition, and the sources of new ideas and of new knowledge. That&#x2019;s a big subject, and I only understand a little bit of it, the areas that I&#x2019;ve worked in or experienced myself. Some of this nobody understands very well, it&#x2019;s a task for the future. How about you?! Maybe you can do some work in this area. Maybe you can push the darkness back a millimeter or two! Maybe you can come up with an important new idea, maybe you can imagine a new kind of question to ask, maybe you can transform the landscape by seeing it from a different point of view! That&#x2019;s all it takes, just one little new idea, and lots and lots of hard work to develop it and to convince other people! Maybe you can put a scratch on the rock of eternity!<br><br> Remember that math is a free creation of the human mind and as Cantor&#x2014;the inventor of the modern theory of infinity described by Wallace&#x2014;said, the essence of math resides in its freedom, in the freedom to create. But history judges these creations by their enduring beauty and by the extent to which they illuminate other mathematical ideas or the physical universe, in a word, by their &#x201c;fertility.&#x201d; Just as the beauty of a woman&#x2019;s breasts or the delicious curve of her hips is actually concerned with childbearing, and isn&#x2019;t merely for the delight of painters and photographers, so a math idea&#x2019;s beauty also has something to do with its &#x201c;fertility,&#x201d; with the extent to which it enlightens us, illuminates us, and inspires us with other ideas and suggests unsuspected connections and new viewpoints.<br><br> Anyone can define a new mathematical concept&#x2014;many mathematical papers do&#x2014;but only the beautiful and the fertile ones survive. It&#x2019;s sort of similar to what Darwin termed &#x201c;sexual selection,&#x201d; which is the way animals (including us) choose their mates for their beauty. This is a part of Darwin&#x2019;s original theory of evolution that nowadays one usually doesn&#x2019;t hear much about, but in my opinion it is much to be preferred to the &#x201c;survival of the fittest&#x201d; and the &#x201c;nature red in tooth and claw&#x201d; views of biological evolution. As an example of this unfortunate neglect, in a beautiful edition of Darwin&#x2019;s The Descent of Man that I happen to possess, several chapters on sexual selection have been completely eliminated!<br><br> So this gives some idea of the themes that I&#x2019;ll be exploring with you.

I finished it as Casey Stengel."--The Cincinnati Enquirer<br><br>Tim McCarver, baseball's preeminent analyst, has set down all that he knows about how the game should be played and watched. With his trademark wit and style, McCarver explains the fundamentals and proper mechanics at the level necessary for success in the major leagues. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans is a gold mine for all fans, brain surgeons or otherwise, and anyone learning how to play or coach the game. (Even major leaguers will pick up some pointers.) After the wonderful 1998 season, America's pastime has never been more popular, and with the deeper knowledge and understanding of baseball that Brain Surgeons provides, any fan will be able to watch it like a pro.</p><p>On the surface, baseball looks like such an easy game--you throw the ball, you hit the ball, you catch the ball, and you run around the bases--but there are so many beautiful and hidden facets to the diamond. If anyone knows the game's on-field secrets, it's Tim McCarver. He caught in the Majors for 21 seasons, handling such Hall of Fame hurlers as Bob Gibson and Steve Carlton. Since hanging up his spikes almost two decades ago, he's been one of the game's most visible, thoughtful, and instructive analysts.<p> McCarver's <i>Baseball for Brain Surgeons</i> is just that: a packed, at times densely penned, manual for smart and inquisitive fans, written <i>up</i> to their hunger for good, solid, challenging insight into the game's tactics, strategies, and maneuverings. McCarver goes into impressively thorough detail, which is his ultimate strength and occasional weakness; he assumes you've already got at least a baseball B.A. If you don't know a cut fastball from a four-seamer, you might consider applying elsewhere until you do, but if you are indeed up to the demands of a provocative graduate seminar, McCarver's quite a professor. He's an engaging storyteller, he never hides his biases, and while he's naturally strong on his perceptions into the game's most primal relationship of pitcher and catcher, he's never less than major league everywhere else around the diamond.</p>"The most intelligent book ever written about our secular national religion."<br>--Pete Hamill<br><br>"Read any chapter and you'll never watch baseball again <br>in quite the same way."--The Arizona Republic<br><br>"McCarver and Peary answer virtually every strategic question about <br>how the sport is played." --Baseball Weekly<br><br>"One of the most significant baseball books in years."--Publishers Weekly</p><h2>Pastoral Counseling</h2><p><p>In this invaluable resource for pastors and seminarians, James Dittes offers answers to some of a minister's basic counseling questions: how do I guide counseling conversations yet empower those who feel helpless?

Some of the most popular and influential architects and designers of the past 150 years&#x2014;Norman Bel Geddes and Richard Neutra, working in the US; Robert Mallet-Stevens in France; and Berthold Lubetkin in the UK&#x2014;designed houses that could be defined as being in the Art Deco style. And Art Deco enjoys a new popularity today, unrivalled since its inception in the 1920s.<br>In <b>The Art Deco House</b>, architectural historian Adrian Tinniswood combines fascinating text and stunning photography to create an essential reference for anyone who loves Art Deco design. Captivating chapters provide detailed overviews of the design, decoration, furnishings, and gardens of the Art Deco house, covering such themes as streamline moderns; Modernist ideas for estates and apartment blocks; urbanism and domestic design; and more. Within each chapter, special stand-alone features draw upon contemporary literature, magazines, and museum exhibitions to demonstrate the style and philosophy of the Art Deco movement.<br>This remarkable guide also features hundreds of stunning, full-color examples of a broad range of Art Deco houses, including the House of Tomorrow by Norman Bel Geddes; the Henry House in Utrecht, Holland; Geragh in Sandycove, Dublin; and Rudolf Schindler's Los Angeles home.<br>� An essential source-book of Art Deco style, with scores of resplendent illustrations <br><br>� Features little-known houses from the US, France, Ireland, Germany, and Austria <br><br>� Provides fascinating insight into the lives of Art Deco architects and their clients <br><br>� Art Deco style is enjoying a resurgence in popularity</p><p><b>Adrian Tinniswood</b> has worked for Britain's leading heritage organization, the National Trust, as an author, editor, and educational consultant for 15 years. His recent books include <i>The Polite Tourist</i> and <i>The Arts &amp; Crafts House</i> (Watson-Guptill, 1999). He lives in Bath, England.Tinniswood, author of <i>The Arts &amp; Crafts House</i> (1999), celebrates the boldness, flair, and sweep of the art deco movement and its innovative, technology-based design vocabulary. Its influence was pervasive and international and impacted architecture both exterior and interior, public and private. Focusing on the latter, Tinniswood captures the extraordinary range of art deco homes in places as far-flung as Los Angeles and Santa Monica and Dublin and Havana. Chrome, glass, and tubular steel replaced the more traditional woods and natural fabrics of the past, as did a growing interest in Meso-American and Native American motifs first rediscovered and embraced by Frank Lloyd Wright, who had a tremendous influence on European architectural design in the 1910s and 1920s, culminating in the high deco peak at the famous 1925 Paris Exposition. This handsome coffee-table volume's clearly written and informative text and generous spreads of color and black-and-white photographs of 34 spectacular homes ensure this title its place as a major design sourcebook and a must-see for the legions of art deco fanatics. <i>Whitney Scott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Worshiped and celebrated, she has been depicted in ways both ethereal and crude: it was her image that inspired Praxiteles to introduce the female nude into Western art. As an icon of female sexuality, Aphrodite's effigy has graced everything from ancient temples to modern cosmetics labels. The ancients, knowing that love conquers all, considered her mightier than Hercules. <i>Aphrodite and the Gods of Love</i> presents, for the first time, a comprehensive and scholarly appreciation of the love deity. Via more than 100 marble sculptures, painted vases, precious metals, mosaics and gems--as well as contemporary depictions by artists such as Jim Dine--the book traces the early worship of Aphrodite as a fertility figure in the Near East, her emergence as love goddess for the Greeks and her eventual adaptation by Rome as Venus. It highlights the myths surrounding this icon of sensuality, notably regarding seduction and marriage, and presents the circle of her lovers and children, such as Eros, Hermaphrodite and Priapos, also tracing how the cult of Aphrodite continues into the present day. A feast for the eye and a celebration of desire, <i>Aphrodite and the Gods of Love</i> is sure to prove the year's sexiest catalogue.</p><p></p><h2>A House in Sicily</h2><p>An American woman who inherited a house in Sicily in 1947 tells the enchanting story of why she decided to stay, and the four decades of good living she has had in a small Italian village--the goodwill of her neighbors and her numerous guests, who included Tennessee Williams and Henry Faulkner.</p><p>"I had always been a bit of a maverick," writes Daphne Phelps, looking back on why--at the age of 34--when she unexpectedly inherited a grand house in Taormina, Sicily, she gave up her profession in London, left behind her ordered life with its museums, theater, family and friends, and embarked on a life-long adventure. Reading her intriguing memoir, one is glad Phelps chose the unconventional path: after inheriting her uncle's Casa Cuseni with its terraced gardens and staggering views of Mt. Etna, she struggles to make ends meet, but instead of selling the estate, opens its doors to a steady stream of paying guests and visitors--many of them artists, writers, and intellectuals. <p> Inheriting an estate in Italy in 1947 isn't quite like winning the lottery, it turns out. In short sketches, Phelps reminisces about stepping into small-town Sicilian life, war-weary, speaking very little Italian, and even more scandalous, being unmarried. With her no-nonsense British humor, she recounts the typical conversation with men, young and old:<br> "Are you married?"<br> "No."<br> "When are you going to get married?"<br> "<i>Chi lo sa</i>--who knows?'" <br> And then, "Why aren't you married?"</p><p> Settling into daily life at Casa Cuseni, Phelps dons boots and digs into the garden, rolls up her sleeves and cleans the baroque carvings over the salon fireplace, and learns to manage the property and its full-time staff. As she points out in the book's conclusion, for more than 50 years now, house-related problems have kept her on her toes--those, and her amazingly devoted servant, cook, and even the local Mafia don, whom she all describes with more than a little condescension in a series of deft portraits. While Phelps's cynicism can be a bit hard to take when she's serving up her servants, she is, perhaps, at her best when telling stories about her famous houseguests: Bertrand Russell, Henry Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, even Roald Dahl. Some were charming, some were horrid. But the visitors came from 26 countries, with friends introducing their friends. Around the dining room table and in this volume Phelps has mixed people who in "normal life would be unlikely to meet." It is this Sicilian menagerie--anchored to a singular place and time, and viewed through a British prism--that makes Phelps's life story so worth the telling. <i>--Kimberly Brown</i></p>Another memoir by a British subject extolling the virtues of Italy and the Italians. But Phelps is in many ways outside the mold. To begin with, she is a woman and a former social worker. Just as importantly, she settled in Sicily, not Tuscany. Sicily is a world away from Tuscany; the Baroque and Arab influence are more in evidence here than Renaissance classicism. At 36, Phelps inherited Casa Cuseni, generally acknowledged to be one of the finest houses in Taormina, in the northeast corner of Sicily. Without meaning to, she fell in love with the house and the locals, a colorful cast of characters, including Concetta Genio, housekeeper and friend. By transforming the Casa Cuseni into a modest pensione, she managed to keep it for the past half-century and attract an eccentric group of English, American, and foreign visitors. These included Bertrand Russell, Roald Dahl, and Tennessee Williams. In the process, she collected a menagerie of animals and innumerable friends, and was named godmother to a troupe of Sicilian puppets. Adding a charming aspect to the work is the clash of cultures: English and Sicilian, Protestant and Catholic, Mediterranean male and northern European female (the sight of Phelps behind the steering wheel of an automobile is cause for an entire town to turn out to witness the never-before-seen spectacle.) Phelps has a deep-seated empathy for the poverty of the Sicilians, but an anticommunist bias that fails to understand the social cause of that orientation. In the end, the cast of characters is more interesting than the author herself; not because of the self-effacing nature of the writing, but because of the colorful and charismatic culture that Phelps finds herself immersed in. The house itself has been officially declared a site of ``cultural and historic importance,'' no mean feat in Italy. A charming memoir that only begins to uncover the myriad facets of life and culture in Sicily. (8 pages color photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He is widely recognised as the greatest 20th-century writer of humour in the English language. Perhaps best known for the escapades of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, Wodehouse also created the world of Blandings Castle, home to Lord Emsworth and his cherished pig, the Empress of Blandings. His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler&#39;s Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club. In 1936 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for `having made an outstanding and lasting contribution to the happiness of the world&#39;. He was made a Doctor of Letters by Oxford University in 1939 and in 1975, aged 93, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He died shortly afterwards, on St Valentine&#39;s Day.The 11 stories in this collection are classic Wodehouse. This means they are hysterically funny, but his writing style places special demands on a reader. Can a narrator deliver silly names like Cyril (Barmy) Fotheringay Phipps with a straight face? With gusto even? Can the distinct accents of the different British classes be mastered? Regional dialects? Happily, the answer to each of these is yes, due to Jonathan Cecil's masterful narration. More than a reading, Cecil delivers what seems to be a full cast performance all by himself, as he shifts pace, tone, even breath quality, to bring dozens of characters to life. This recording is a rare treat.

Koch's imagination is at once philosophical and fiercely whimsical; his digressions are always clever. Lines from "Fresh Air" capture the frustrations felt by his generation of writers in the '50s and '60s: "Where are young poets in America, they are trembling in publishing houses and universities,/ Above all they are/ trembling in universities, they are bathing the library steps with their spit/ They are gargling out innocuous (to whom?) poems about maple trees and their children... Oh what worms they are! They wish to perfect their form." Also featured are excerpts from longer poetical works, most notably "The Art of Poetry," detailing 10 rules to be observed before a poet "releases" a poem into "the purview of others" (the seventh: "Is there any unwanted awkwardness, cheap effects... or other literary, 'kiss-me-I'm-poetic' junk?"). At times, one could read Koch's playfulness as a "cheap effect," yet that would be unfair. For another Koch poetic directive is to be "young in one's heart." Whether writing with virtuoso skill in ottava rima, blank verse or free verse, Koch practices what he preaches. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fighting Napoleon: The Recollections of Lieutenant John Hildebrand 35th Foot in the Mediterranean and Waterloo Campaigns</h2><p>It is often forgotten that Britain&#x2019;s struggle against Napoleon ranged across the continents, and the extensive operations of the Royal Navy and the British Army in the Mediterranean was a key battleground in this prolonged war of attrition.

The individual is the Japanese admiral who, as architect of the Pearl Harbor raid and commander of the Combined Fleet throughout the first part of World War II, is one of the most widely known of Japanese wartime leaders. The organization is the Japanese Imperial Navy, whose "gentlemanly" traditions and outlook contrasted strongly with those of the Japanese army and whose failure to check the latter in its headstrong course makes one of the sadder episodes of recent history. <p>Here, for the first time, Yamamoto emerges as the complex, sympathetic, and in many ways contradictory character that he was. A realist who foresaw the future importance of the airplane for the navy long before his contemporaries and who believed that Japan would inevitably be defeated in any war with America and Britain, he was also an inveterate gambler with an odd streak of superstition. A tough leader, he had at the same time a vein of sentimentality that would allow him to burst into tears at the funeral of a young subordinate. In public the very epitome of the dignified national hero, in private he often showed a schoolboyish playfulness that was sometimes endearing and occasionally embarrassing. He was always ready to express his views with a frankness uncommon in his day, yet he revealed in the end the same readiness as most of his fellow countrymen to accept passively "the call of duty." </p><p>The author, refusing the temptation to indulge in speculation or "reconstruction," has gone straight to the original sources--accounts written by those who worked with Yamamoto; scores of interviews with men and women who knew him personally; above all, letters written by Yamamoto himself. The latter range from his more circumspect, semi-official communications to intimate letters addressed to his mistress or long-standing friends of both sexes, in which he bares his private doubts and pessimism. It is these personal documents and reminiscences that make the character so human and, ultimately, give such a moving quality to the account of his dramatic wartime death in the South Pacific. </p><p>An intimate portrait of the man who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor and died a dramatic death in the South Pacific.</p></p><p>On board the flagship Nagato in the anchorage at Hashirajima, the evening of December 7 found Yamamoto, as usual, playing shogi with staff officer Watanabe. These games between Yamamoto and Watanabe usually came to an end after Yamamoto had won four times in succession, but very occasionally Watanabe instead would win several games in a row. This invariably happened when a low-pressure front was approaching; possibly Yamamoto was the type that is allergic to changes in the weather. That particular evening, however, it was fine, and Yamamoto won. They finished playing rather earlier than usual, then Yamamoto and his staff officers bathed and retired temporarily to their own cabins. <p>Some of them slept for two or three hours, others could not sleep at all, but not long after midnight most of the staff officers were once again assembled in small groups in the operations room. The officer on duty was air "B" staff officer Sasaki Akira. </p><p>The four walls of the operations room were plastered with large maps of the entire Pacific area and charts of various zones of Southeast Asian waters. On the table were a large globe and still more charts, and on a smaller table files of operational orders and radio messages. </p><p>Yamamoto was sitting quite still, eyes shut, in a folding chair in front of the big table at the back. </p><p>News came in of the army's landing at Kota Bharu, then of the successful landing at Bataan in the Philippines. There followed a long and trying period of waiting. Time seemed to drag interminably. An uneasy silence prevailed in the operations room. No one spoke; the only sounds were the rustle of messages being flipped over in their files and the occasional scratching of a pencil. </p><p>Across the passage lay the radio room, from which a cord led to a receiver standing on the table in the operations room, so that those present could hear directly any messages that came in. Eventually, senior staff officer Kuroshima said in a quiet voice, "It should begin any moment now." </p><p>He glanced up at the clock on the bulkhead, and a stir ran through the room. At that moment, the radio operator came running in and shouted at the staff officer on duty: "Sir--the repeated to signal." </p><p>Sasaki turned to the commander in chief. "As you hear, sir," he reported. "The message was sent at 0319 hours." </p><p>Yamamoto opened his eyes wide and nodded. His mouth turned down grimly at the corners. "Did you get that message direct from the plane?" he asked the operator. The Nagato's radio room had, in fact, received the "to, to, to, to..." direct from the skies over Oahu. </p><p>"Direct reception?" said Ugaki. "Good work!" The young operator looked pleased, saluted, and rushed out of the room again. </p><p>There followed a succession of reports from the attacking units: </p><p>"Surprise attack successful." </p><p>"Enemy warships torpedoed; outstanding results." </p><p>"Hickam Field attacked; outstanding results." </p><p>At the same time, the radio in the operations room was picking up directly a great number of uncoded radio messages from the American side. From what Ugaki says in his Sensoroku, the messages tended to be broken and jerky: "SOS--attacked by Jap bombers here...." or "Oahu attacked by Jap dive-bombers from carrier...." When Yamamoto heard one of them--"Jap!--this is the real thing"--a brief grin seemed to pass over his face. </p><p>Exactly one hour after the first assault, the second attack force led by Lieutenant Commander Shimazaki Shigekazu, 170 planes in all, swept into the skies over Pearl Harbor and also achieved considerable results before withdrawing. By the time dawn broke over Hiroshima Bay, the number of messages being received in the operations room of the Nagato was dwindling steadily. </p><p>From any point of view, the raid had been an outstanding success, and the staff officers could not conceal their jubilation; Yamamoto alone, apparently, remained sunk in apparent depression.</p>Text: English, Japanese (translation)</p><h2>The Ultimate Cyberpunk</h2><p>Exploring the interface between mind and machine, this collection of short fiction includes a wide range of cyberpunk stories by such renowned authors as Alfred Bester, Samuel R.

Cheerful, cheeky, occasionally outrageous MIT psychologist Steven Pinker answers all of the above and more in his marvelously fun, awesomely informative survey of modern brain science. Pinker argues that Darwin plus canny computer programs are the key to understanding ourselves--but he also throws in apt references to <i>Star Trek</i>, <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>The Far Side</i>, history, literature, W.

He was born in 1911 in County Tyrone. A resident of Dublin, he graduated from University College after a brilliant career as a student (editing a magazine called Blather) and joined the Civil Service, in which he eventually attained a senior position. He wrote throughout his life, which ended in Dublin on April 1, 1966. His other novels include The Dalkey Archive, The Third Policeman, The Hard Life, and The Poor Mouth, all available from Dalkey Archive Press.

Culled from na gCopaleen's WWII period work and never before published in book form, the columns veer from virulent invective to "a good laugh." Jackson notes that "the original reader opening his morning paper had no idea whether Myles was going to amuse, anger, surprise, disgust or bore him," and his selection preserves the chronological order of the original publication in an effort to "restore something of Myles' unpredictability." However, the erratic groupings, tacked together by the editor's enigmatic chapter titles and notes, appear inchoate and limp, compared to other collections of na gCopaleen's columns (The Best of Myles and Further Cuttings from Cruiskeen Lawn). Still, na gCopaleen's penchant for offbeat subjects (such as Ibsen's dandruff), his caustic wit ("I am, as you know, an Irish person and I yield to gnomon in my admiration and respect for the old land.") and playful puns ("As for drink, they tell me it gives you a red nose, a complaint that can be passed on to your children. Damn nosa how red it is!") offer a hilarious glimpse of both the meaningful and mundane in WWII Ireland. When the layers are peeled away, they reveal an imaginative comic genius with a genuine gift for language. Hector McDonnell's cartoons add to the hilarity. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Man with the Violin</h2><p>Who is playing that beautiful music in the subway? And why is nobody listening? This gorgeous picture book is based on the true story of Joshua Bell, the renowned American violinist who famously took his instrument down into the Washington D.C. subway for a free concert. More than a thousand commuters rushed by him, but only seven stopped to listen for more than a minute. In The Man with the Violin, bestselling author Kathy Stinson has woven a heart-warming story that reminds us all to stop and appreciate the beauty that surrounds us. Dylan is someone who notices things. His mom is someone who doesn&#x2019;t. So try as he might, Dylan can&#x2019;t get his mom to listen to the man playing the violin in the subway station. With the beautiful music in his head all day long, Dylan can&#x2019;t forget the violinist, and finally succeeds in making his mother stop and listen, too. Vividly imagined text combined with illustrations that pulse with energy expertly demonstrate the transformative power of music.

For the Dosadi have bred for Vengeance as well as cunning, and they have learned how to pass through the shimmering God Wall to exact their dreadful revenge on the Universe that created them . . .</p></p><p><p><b>Frank Herbert</b> (1920-1986) created the most beloved novel in the annals of science fiction, <i>Dune</i>. He was a man of many facets, of countless passageways that ran through an intricate mind. His magnum opus is a reflection of this, a classic work that stands as one of the most complex, multi-layered novels ever written in any genre. Today the novel is more popular than ever, with new readers continually discovering it and telling their friends to pick up a copy. It has been translated into dozens of languages and has sold almost 20 million copies.</p><p>As a child growing up in Washington State, Frank Herbert was curious about everything. He carried around a Boy Scout pack with books in it, and he was always reading. He loved Rover Boys adventures, as well as the stories of H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, and the science fiction of Edgar Rice Burroughs. On his eighth birthday, Frank stood on top of the breakfast table at his family home and announced, "I wanna be a author." His maternal grandfather, John McCarthy, said of the boy, "It's frightening. A kid that small shouldn't be so smart." Young Frank was not unlike Alia in <i>Dune</i>, a person having adult comprehension in a child's body. In grade school he was the acknowledged authority on everything. If his classmates wanted to know the answer to something, such as about sexual functions or how to make a carbide cannon, they would invariably say, "Let's ask Herbert. He'll know."</p><p>His curiosity and independent spirit got him into trouble more than once when he was growing up, and caused him difficulties as an adult as well. He did not graduate from college because he refused to take the required courses for a major; he only wanted to study what interested him. For years he had a hard time making a living, bouncing from job to job and from town to town. He was so independent that he refused to write for a particular market; he wrote what he felt like writing. It took him six years of research and writing to complete <i>Dune</i>, and after all that struggle and sacrifice, 23 publishers rejected it in book form before it was finally accepted. He received an advance of only $7,500.</p><p>His loving wife of 37 years, Beverly, was the breadwinner much of the time, as an underpaid advertising writer for department stores. Having been divorced from his first wife, Flora Parkinson, Frank Herbert met Beverly Stuart at a University of Washington creative writing class in 1946. At the time, they were the only students in the class who had sold their work for publication. Frank had sold two pulp adventure stories to magazines, one to <i>Esquire</i> and the other to <i>Doc Savage</i>. Beverly had sold a story to <i>Modern Romance</i> magazine. These genres reflected the interests of the two young lovers; he the adventurer, the strong, machismo man, and she the romantic, exceedingly feminine and soft-spoken.</p><p>Their marriage would produce two sons, Brian, born in 1947, and Bruce, born in 1951. Frank also had a daughter, Penny, born in 1942 from his first marriage. For more than two decades Frank and Beverly would struggle to make ends meet, and there were many hard times. In order to pay the bills and to allow her husband the freedom he needed in order to create, Beverly gave up her own creative writing career in order to support his. They were in fact a writing team, as he discussed every aspect of his stories with her, and she edited his work. Theirs was a remarkable, though tragic, love story-which Brian would poignantly describe one day in <i>Dreamer of Dune</i> (Tor Books; April 2003). After Beverly passed away, Frank married Theresa Shackelford. </p><p>In all, Frank Herbert wrote nearly 30 popular books and collections of short stories, including six novels set in the <i>Dune</i> universe: <i>Dune</i>, <i>Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune</i>, <i>Heretics of Dune</i>, and <i>Chapterhouse: Dune</i>. All were international bestsellers, as were a number of his other science fiction novels, which include <i>The White Plague</i> and <i>The Dosadi Experiment</i>. His major novels included <i>The Dragon in the Sea</i>, <i>Soul Catcher</i> (his only non-science fiction novel), <i>Destination:</i> <i>Void</i>, <i>The Santaroga Barrier</i>, <i>The Green Brain</i>, <i>Hellstorm's Hive</i>, <i>Whipping Star</i>, <i>The Eyes of</i> <i>Heisenberg</i>, <i>The Godmakers</i>, <i>Direct Descent</i>, and <i>The Heaven Makers</i>. He also collaborated with Bill Ransom to write <i>The Jesus Incident</i>, <i>The Lazarus Effect</i>, and <i>The Ascension Factor</i>. Frank Herbert's last published novel, <i>Man of Two Worlds</i>, was a collaboration with his son, Brian.</p><p><em>Justice belongs to those who claim it, but let the claimant beware lest he create new injustice by his claim and thus set the bloody pendulum of revenge into its inexorable motion</em>.<br>--Gowachin aphorism<br>Why are you so cold and mechanical in your Human relationships?&#x201d;<br><br>Jorj X. McKie was to reflect on that Caleban question later. Had she been trying to alert him to the Dosadi Experiment and to what his investigation of that experiment might do to him? He hadn&#x2019;t even known about Dosadi at the time and the pressures of the Caleban communications trance, the accusatory tone she took, had precluded other considerations.<br><br>Still, it rankled. He didn&#x2019;t like the feeling that he might be a subject of her research into Humans. He&#x2019;d always thought of that particular Caleban as his friend--if one could consider being friendly with a creature whose visible manifestation in this universe was a fourth-magnitude yellow sun visible from Central Central where the Bureau of Sabotage maintained its headquarters. And there was inevitable discomfort in Caleban communication. You sank into a trembling, jerking trance while they made their words appear in your consciousness.<br><br>But his uncertainty remained: had she tried to tell him something beyond the plain content of her words?<br><br>When the weather makers kept the evening rain period short, McKie liked to go outdoors immediately afterward and stroll in the park enclosure which BuSab provided for its employees on Central Central. As a Saboteur Extraordinary, McKie had free run of the enclosure and he liked the fresh smells of the place after a rain.<br><br>The park covered about thirty hectares, deep in a well of Bureau buildings. It was a scrambling hodgepodge of plantings cut by wide paths which circled and twisted through specimens from every inhabited planet of the known universe. No care had been taken to provide a particular area for any sentient species. If there was any plan to the park it was a maintenance plan with plants requiring similar conditions and care held in their own sectors. Giant Spear Pines from Sasak occupied a knoll near one corner surrounded by mounds of Flame Briar from Rudiria. There were bold stretches of lawn and hidden scraps of lawn, and some flat stretches of greenery which were not lawns at all but mobile sheets of predatory leaf imprisoned behind thin moats of caustic water.<br><br>Rain-jeweled flowers often held McKie&#x2019;s attention to the exclusion of all else. There was a single planting of Lilium Grossa, its red blossoms twice his height casting long shadows over a wriggling carpet of blue Syringa, each miniature bloom opening and closing at random like tiny mouths gasping for air.<br><br>Sometimes, floral perfumes stopped his progress and held him in a momentary olfactory thralldom while his eyes searched out the source. As often as not, the plant would be a dangerous one--a flesh eater or poison-sweat variety. Warning signs in flashing Galach guarded such plantings. Sonabarriers, moats, and force fields edged the winding paths in many areas.<br><br>McKie had a favorite spot in the park, a bench with its back to a fountain where he could sit and watch the shadows collect across fat yellow bushes from the floating islands of Tandaloor. The yellow bushes thrived because their roots were washed in running water hidden beneath the soil and renewed by the fountain. Beneath the yellow bushes there were faint gleams of phosphorescent silver enclosed by a force field and identified by a low sign:<br><br>&#x201c;Sangeet Mobilus, a blood-sucking perennial from Bisaj. Extreme danger to all sentient species. Do not intrude any portion of your body beyond the force field.&#x201d;<br><br>As he sat on the bench, McKie thought about that sign. The universe often mixed the beautiful and the dangerous. This was a deliberate mixture in the park. The yellow bushes, the fragrant and benign Golden Iridens, had been mingled with Sangeet Mobilus. The two supported each other and both thrived. The ConSentient government which McKie served often made such mixtures...sometimes by accident.<br><br>Sometimes by design.<br><br>He listened to the splashing of the fountain while the shadows thickened and the tiny border lights came on along the paths. The tops of the buildings beyond the park became a palette where the sunset laid out its final display of the day.<br><br>In that instant, the Caleban contact caught him and he felt his body slip into the helpless communications trance. The mental tendrils were immediately identified--Fannie Mae. And he thought, as he often had, what an improbable name that was for a star entity. He heard no sounds, but his hearing centers responded as to spoken words, and the inward glow was unmistakable. It was Fannie Mae, her syntax far more sophisticated than during their earliest encounters.<br><br>&#x201c;You admire one of us,&#x201c; she said, indicating his attention on the sun which had just set beyond the buildings.<br><br>&#x201c;I try not to think of any star as a Caleban,&#x201c; he responded. &#x201c;It interferes with my awareness of the natural beauty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Natural? McKie, you don&#x2019;t understand your own awareness, nor even how you employ it!&#x201d;<br><br>That was her beginning--accusatory, attacking, unlike any previous contact with this Caleban he&#x2019;d thought of as friend. And she employed her verb forms with new deftness, almost as though showing off, parading her understanding of his language.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you want, Fannie Mae?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I consider your relationships with females of your species. You have entered marriage relationships which number more than fifty. Not so?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Yes. Why do you...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am your friend, McKie. What is your feeling toward me?&#x201d;<br><br>He thought about that. There was a demanding intensity in her question. He owed his life to this Caleban with an improbable name. For that matter, she owed her life to him. Together, they&#x2019;d resolved the Whipping Star threat. Now, many Calebans provided the jumpdoors by which other beings moved in a single step from planet to planet, but once Fannie Mae had held all of those jumpdoor threads, her life threatened through the odd honor code by which Calebans maintained their contractual obligations. And McKie had saved her life. He had but to think about their past interdependence and a warm sense of camaraderie suffused him.<br><br>Fannie Mae sensed this.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, McKie, that is friendship, is love. Do you possess this feeling toward Human female companions?&#x201d;<br><br>Her question angered him. Why was she prying? His private sexual relationships were no concern of hers!<br><br>&#x201c;Your love turns easily to anger,&#x201c; she chided.<br><br>&#x201c;There are limits to how deeply a Saboteur Extraordinary can allow himself to be involved with anyone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which came first, McKie--the Saboteur Extraordinary or these limits?&#x201d;<br><br>Her response carried obvious derision. Had he chosen the Bureau because he was incapable of warm relationships? But he really cared for Fannie Mae! He admired her...and she could hurt him because he admired her and felt...felt <em>this way</em>.<br><br>He spoke out of his anger and hurt.<br><br>&#x201c;Without the Bureau there&#x2019;d be no ConSentiency and no need for Calebans.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, indeed. People have but to look at a dread agent from BuSab and know fear.&#x201d;<br><br>It was intolerable, but he couldn&#x2019;t escape the underlying warmth he felt toward this strange Caleban entity, this being who could creep unguarded into his mind and talk to him as no other being dared. If only he had found a woman to share that kind of intimacy...<br><br>And this was the part of their conversation which came back to haunt him. After months with no contact between them, why had she chosen that moment--just three days before the Dosadi crisis burst upon the Bureau? She&#x2019;d pulled out his ego, his deepest sense of identity. She&#x2019;d shaken that ego and then she&#x2019;d skewered him with her barbed question:<br><br>&#x201c;<em>Why are you so cold and mechanical in your Human relationships</em>?&#x201d;<br><br>Her irony could not be evaded. She&#x2019;d made him appear ridiculous in his own eyes. He could feel warmth, yes...even love, for a Caleban but not for a Human female. This unguarded feeling he held for Fannie Mae had never been directed at any of his marital companions. Fannie Mae had aroused his anger, then reduced his anger to verbal breast-beating, and finally to silent hurt. Still, the love remained.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Human females were bed partners. They were bodies which used him and which he used. That was out of the question with this Caleban. She was a star burning with atomic fires, her seat of consciousness unimaginable to other sentients. Yet, she could extract love from him. He gave this love freely and she knew it. There was no hiding an emotion from a Caleban when she sent her mental tendrils into your awareness.<br><br>She&#x2019;d certainly known he would see the irony. That had to be part of her motive in such an attack. But Calebans seldom acted from a single motive--which was part of their charm and the essence of their most irritant exchanges with other sentient beings.<br><br>&#x201c;McKie?&#x201d; Softly in his mind.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Angry.<br><br>&#x201c;I show you now a fractional bit of my feeling toward your node.&#x201d;<br><br>Like a balloon being inflated by a swift surge of gas, he felt himself suffused by a projected sense of concern, of caring. He was drowning in it...wanted to drown in it. His entire body radiated this white-hot sense of protective attention. For a whole minute after it was withdrawn, he still glowed with it.<br><br><em>A fractional bit</em>?<br><br>&#x201c;McKie?&#x201d; <em>Concerned?</em>.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&amp;rdquo...</p></p><h2>Wars of the Roses: Trinity: Book Two</h2><p>The brilliant retelling of the Wars of the Roses continues with Trinity, the second gripping novel in the new series from historical fiction master, Conn Iggulden. 1454: King Henry VI has remained all but exiled in Windsor Castle, struck down by his illness for over a year, his eyes vacant, his mind a blank. His fiercely loyal wife and Queen, Margaret of Anjou, safeguards her husband&#39;s interests, hoping that her son Edward will one day know the love of his father. Richard Duke of York, Protector of the Realm, extends his influence throughout the kingdom with each month that Henry slumbers. The Earls of Salisbury and Warwick make up a formidable trinity with Richard, and together they seek to break the support of those who would raise their colours in the name of Henry and his Queen. But when the King unexpectedly recovers his senses and returns to London to reclaim his throne, the balance of power is once again thrown into turmoil. The clash of the Houses of Lancaster and York will surely mean a war to tear England apart . . .

Reprint.</p><p>This 1993 winner of the James Tiptree Jr. Award focuses on Zhang Zhong Shan, a young engineer in a U.S. dominated by a hugely successful Marxist China. The fact that he&#39;s gay in an era where homosexuality is punishable by death, and that he&#39;s only half Asian--his mother was Hispanic, but his parents had his genes altered to suppress his ancestry--add to his frustration and feelings of oppression. When he loses his place in the social labor system, Zhang moves to Shanghai and finds work within a Marxist system whose injustices he recognizes and whose delusions he resists. Using the resources available, Zhang struggles to shape a place for himself, and manages to affect the lives of others in the process.With her first novel, China Mountain Zhang, Maureen McHugh established herself as a major writer of humanist SF, one of the most distinctive and talented to emerge this decade.</p><h2>Calico and Tin Horns</h2><p>Hannah&#39;s parents think that she is too young to be involved in their resistance against their unfair landlord, until the sheriff&#39;s posse comes after her father and Hannah is able to sound the warning signal</p><p>Based on a true story of America's early days as a nation, <i>Calico and Tin Horns</i> celebrates the victory of a group of farmers who band together to fight for land that has been promised to them for generations. Told in the voice of Hannah, the young daughter of one of the struggling farm families, this poignant story is not only a triumph of the working man over greedy landowners, but the victory of a brave young girl who saves her family and the land that will eventually become theirs. Beautiful oil paintings lend a sense of reality to this lovely retelling of a slice of American history.Grade 1-4-- A picture book based on Hudson Valley history. A preface explains that after the Revolutionary War, wealthy landowners failed to honor a promise to sell land to the farmers who worked it. After generations of such abuse, the farmers rebelled, and stopped turning over ``harvest rent'' to landowners. Dressed as local Indians in calico with leather masks, they banded together to fight evictions. The daughter of one such farmer, Hannah, who narrates, is curious about but excluded from the secret goings-on at home. Then, while berry-picking one day, she sees the sheriff and his men approaching her farm and manages to warn her family and others. The resulting confrontation is less of a surprise, the farmers finally force the sheriff into meeting their terms, and Hannah is praised by her father. Unfortunately, there are elements here that will puzzle readers. The pacing is erratic, and particularly abrupt at the big fight scene. Although it's easy to speculate, there is no explanation given for why the farmers chose the calico Indian disguise, and references to Native Americans are confusing. The preface doesn't help enough, yet without it, there's insufficient information to make sense out of the story. With supplementary material, the book might be useful for older children. Locker's panoramas don't particularly enliven the text, but do convey the summer beauty of the valley. --Leda Schubert, Vermont Department of Education, Montpelier<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Quartet in Autumn</h2><p>This is the story of four people in late middle-age - Edwin, Norman, Letty and Marcia - whose chief point of contact is that they work in the same office and they suffer the same problem - loneliness. Lovingly, poignantly, satirically and with much humour, Pym conducts us through their small lives and the facade they erect to defend themselves against the outside world. There is nevertheless an obstinate optimism in her characters, allowing them in their different ways to win through to a kind of hope. Barbara Pym's sensitive wit and artistry are at their most sparkling in "Quartet in Autumn". 'An exquisite, even magnificent work of art' - "Observer". 'Barbara Pym has a sharp eye for the exact nuances of social behaviour' - "The Times". 'The wit and style of a twentieth century Jane Austen' - "Harpers &amp; Queen". 'Barbara Pym's unpretentious, subtle, accomplished novels are for me the finest examples of high comedy to have appeared in England during the past 75 years ...spectacular' - "Sunday Times". 'Very funny and keenly observant of the ridiculous as well as the pathetic in humanity' - "Financial Times".</p><p><b>Quartet in Autumn</b> is one of the books Pym wrote during the 15 years when no one would publish her, and perhaps the same kind of balance between hopelessness and inner strength helped shape this novel's story about four friends in an office nearing the age of retirement. They are people who have lived unspectacularly, but who have conjured a sense of themselves from the quartet's unity. Things start to change when two of them retire. Pym maps this ordinary strangeness of life with her particular genius for brilliant psychological insight and quiet humor that never strains for effect.A writer from the age of sixteen, Barbara Pym has been acclaimed as &#39;the most underrated writer of the century&#39; (Philip Larkin). Pym&#39;s substantial reputation evolved through the publication of six novels from 1950 to 1961, then resumed in 1977 with the publication of Quartet in Autumn and three other novels.

Where rage of this intensity is directed outward, we often find the sociopath; where inward, the suicide. Where it breaks out laterally, onto the page, we sometimes find a most unsettling artistic vision."�&#x20ac;&#x201d;Sven Birkerts, <i>The New Republic</i></p><p><b>Thomas Bernhard</b> (1931-89) grew up in Salzburg and Vienna, where he studied music. In 1957 he began a second career as a playwright, poet, and novelist. He went on to win many of the most prestigious literary prizes of Europe (including the Austrian State Prize, the Bremen and Br�chner prizes, and Le Prix S�guier), became one of the most widely admired writers of his generation, and insisted at his death that none of his works be published in Austria for seventy years, a provision later repealed by his half-brother.From March to December, writes Rudolf, while I was having to take large quantities of prednisolone, a fact which I am bound to record here, against the third acute onset of my sarcoidosis, I assembled every possible book and article written by or about Mendelssohn Bartholdy and visited every possible and impossible library in order to acquaint myself thoroughly with my favourite composer and his work, preparing myself with the most passionate seriousness for the task, which I had been dreading throughout the preceding winter, of writing &#x2014; such was my pretension &#x2014; a major work of impeccable scholarship. It had been my intention to devote the most careful study to all these books and articles and only then, having studied them with all the thoroughness the subject deserved, to begin writing my work, which I believed would leave far behind it and far beneath it everything else, both published and unpublished, which I had previously written in the field of what is called musicology. I had been planning it for ten years and had repeatedly failed to bring it to fruition, but now I had resolved to begin writing on the twenty-seventh of January at precisely four o'clock in the morning, after the departure of my sister, who was due to leave on the twenty-sixth, and whose presence in Peiskam had for weeks put paid to any thought of my starting work on Mendelssohn Bartholdy. On the evening of the twenty-sixth my sister had finally gone, with all her dreadful faults, which are the result of her unhealthy craving to dominate and her distrust of everything, but especially of me, a distrust by which she was consumed to a higher degree than anyone else, but from which she daily drew fresh vitality. I went round the house, breathing deeply, and aired it thoroughly. Finally, since tomorrow was the twenty-seventh, I set about arranging everything I needed to carry out my plan, arranging the books and articles, the papers and the piles of notes on my desk in precise accordance with those rules which I had always observed as a precondition for starting work. We must be alone and free from all human contact if we wish to embark upon an intellectual task! These preparations occupied me for more than five hours, from half past eight in the evening until half past two in the morning, and, as was only to be expected, I didn't sleep for the rest of the night, being continually tormented above all by the thought that my sister might return for some reason and frustrate my plans. In her condition she was capable of anything: the smallest incident, the slightest upset, I told myself, would be enough to make her break her journey home and return here. It would not be the first time I had seen her to the Vienna train and parted from her, as I thought, for months, only to have her back in my house two or three hours later to stay for as long as she chose. I lay awake, constantly listening for her at the door, alternating between listening for my sister at the door and thinking about my work, and especially about <i>how</i> to begin it, how the first sentence should run, for I still didn't know <i>how</i> to word the first sentence, and before I know the wording of the first sentence I can't begin any work. So all the time I was tormented by listening for my sister's return and by thinking of how I should word my first sentence on Mendelssohn Bartholdy. Again and again I listened despairingly, and again and again I thought, just as despairingly, about the first sentence of my work on Mendelssohn. I spent about two hours thinking about the first sentence of my Mendelssohn study and at the same time listening for my sister's return, which would put an end to my study before it was even started. However, since I listened for her return with ever increasing intentness, reflecting that, if she did return, she would inevitably ruin my work, while at the same time thinking about the wording of my first sentence, I must finally have nodded off. When I awoke with a start it was five o'clock. I had meant to begin working at four o'clock and now it was five. I was alarmed by this negligence of mine, or rather this lack of discipline. I got up and wrapped myself in a blanket, the horse blanket I had inherited from my maternal grandfather, and tied it round me as tightly as I could with the leather belt which was also inherited from my grandfather, so tightly that I could scarcely breathe. Then I sat down at my desk. Of course it was completely dark. I made sure that I was alone in the house. I could hear nothing except my own pulse beat. I took the four prednisolone tablets, which had been prescribed by the specialist, with a glass of water and smoothed out the sheet of paper I had put in front of me. I'll calm down and begin work, I told myself. Again and again I said to myself, I'll calm down and begin work. But after I had said this about a hundred times and could no longer stop saying it I gave up. My attempt had failed. It was impossible for me to begin work in the early morning light. The dawn had completely dashed my hopes. I got up and fled from my desk. I went downstairs into the hall, believing that I should be able to calm myself there, where it was cold, for by sitting for more than one whole hour at my desk I had worked myself into a state of agitation which made me almost demented, brought on not only by mental concentration, but also, as I had feared, by the prednisolone tablets. I pressed both palms against the cold wall of the hall, a well-tried method for overcoming this kind of agitation, and I actually did calm down. I was conscious of having surrendered myself to a subject which might possibly destroy me, but all the same I had believed that I could at least make a start on my work this morning. I had deluded myself. Although she had gone, I still felt the presence of my sister in every part of the house. It would be impossible to imagine a person more hostile to anything intellectual than my sister. The very thought of her robs me of my capacity for any intellectual activity, and she has always stifled at birth any intellectual projects I have had. She's been gone a long time now, and yet she is still controlling me, I thought as I pressed my hands against the cold wall of the hall. At last I had enough strength to remove them and take a few steps. I also failed in my plan to write something on <i>Jenufa</i>. That was in October, not long before my sister came to stay, I told myself. And now I'm failing with Mendelssohn Bartholdy, I'm failing even when my sister is no longer here. I didn't even finish the sketch On Sch�nberg. She annihilated it for me: first she destroyed it, then she finally annihilated it, by coming into the room at the very moment when I thought I was going to be able to complete it. There's no defence against a person like my sister, who is at once so strong and so anti-intellectual; she comes and annihilates whatever has taken shape in one's mind as a result of exerting, indeed of over-exerting one's memory for months on end, whatever it is, even the most trifling sketch on the most trifling subject. And there's nothing so fragile as music, to which I have actually given myself up completely in recent years. At first I gave myself up to listening to music, then to studying the theory of music; first I devoted myself with the utmost intensity to the practical study of music, then to the theoretical, but my plans were all frustrated by my sister and everybody like her, whose lack of understanding dogs me day and night. She destroyed <i>Jenufa</i> for me, and <i>Moses and Aaron</i>, my essay <i>On Rubinstein</i>, and my article on <i>Les Six</i>, in fact everything I held sacred. It's terrible: no sooner am I capable of a piece of intellectual work than my sister turns up and destroys it. It's as if her sole aim in life were to destroy my intellectual work. It's as if, living in Vienna, she could sense that I am about to embark on a subject here in Peiskam; and when I do, she turns up and destroys it. People exist for the sole purpose of tracking down the intellect and annihilating it. Sensing that somebody's brain is on the point of some intellectual effort, they come along and stifle this intellectual effort at birth. And if it isn't my wretched, malignant, deceitful sister, then it's somebody else of her kind. How many essays have I begun, only to burn them because my sister has turned up, only to throw them in the stove the moment she's appeared! No one is so fond of saying, <i>I'm not disturbing you, am I?</i> That's rich coming from someone who's always disturbed people and always will, whose sole mission in life seems to be to disturb, to disturb anything and everything and so destroy it and finally annihilate it, constantly to annihilate what to me is the most important thing in the world &#x2014; a product of the mind. Even when we were children she would try at every opportunity to disturb me, to drive me out of my mental paradise, as I called it. If I had a book in my hands she would pursue me until I put it down. If, in fury, I threw it in her face, she was triumphant. I remember it all so well: if I had my maps spread out on the floor &#x2014; which is a lifelong passion of mine &#x2014; she would emerge from hiding behind my back and startle me, putting her foot on the very spot where all my attention was concentrated. I can still see her foot placed suddenly and viciously wherever I had spread out my beloved countries and continents in order to fill them full with my childish imaginings. At the age of five or six I used to withdraw into the garden with a book. On one occasion, which I can remember clearly, it was a blue-bound volume of the poems of Novalis from my grandfather's library. In this book, which of course I didn't properly understand, I discovered such delights as were sufficient to fill my Sunday afternoon for hour after hour, until my sister discovered where I was and, darting out from the bushes with a yell, snatched the volume of Novalis from me. Our younger sister was entirely different, but she's been dead for thirty years, and it's senseless to compare her now with my elder sister, to compare one who was always ailing and ill and finally died with one who is always healthy and dominates all around her. Even her husband put up with her for only two and a half years, after which he fled from her stranglehold and went to South America, to Peru, never to be heard of again. She's always destroyed whatever she's touched, and all her life she's tried to destroy me. At first unconsciously, then consciously, she's set out to annihilate me. Right up to this day I've had to protect myself against my elder sister's savage desire to annihilate, and I really don't know how so far I've managed to escape her. She turns up when she feels like it, she leaves when she feels like it, and she does what she feels like doing. She married her husband, who was a real estate broker, <i>in order</i> to drive him to Peru and get complete control of his real estate business. She's a business woman. Even as a very small child she was that way inclined, towards the persecution of the intellect and the closely concomitant pursuit of money. That we should have had the same mother is something I've never been able to understand. She'd now been out of the house for almost twenty-four hours, yet she was still in control of me. I couldn't escape her. I tried desperately but didn't succeed. I'm horrified by the thought that to this day, when she travels by sleeper, she makes a principle of sleeping only in her own sheets. For the third time I flung open the windows and aired the whole house, until the cold air had turned it into an ice-box in which I was in danger of freezing to death. At first I'd been afraid of suffocating; now I was afraid of freezing to death. And all this because of my sister, under whose influence I've been in danger of either suffocating or freezing to death all my life. In her apartment in Vienna she actually stays in bed until half-past-ten and doesn't go for lunch at the Imperial or the Sacher until about half-past-one. There, as she dissects her boiled fillet of beef and sips her vin rose, she does business with her effete princes and with imperial highnesses of every possible and impossible kind. I'm nauseated by the kind of life she leads. On the day of her departure she didn't do a thing to tidy up her room before she left, so that the very sight of it made me feel embarrassed at the thought of what Frau Kienesberger would think, though she was not due to come till the following weekend. She's been keeping the house in order for over ten years. Everything was piled up in three great heaps, and the duvet was lying on the floor. And although I'd opened all the windows, as I've already said, my sister's smell was still in the room. In fact it permeated the house and made me feel sick. She has my younger sister on her conscience, I often think, for she too went in constant fear of her elder sister, towards the end probably in deadly fear. Parents have a child, and in doing so they bring into the world a monster that kills everything it comes into contact with, it seems to me. At one time I'd written an essay on Haydn &#x2014; Michael, not Josef &#x2014; when she suddenly appeared and knocked the pen out of my hand. Since I hadn't finished the essay, it was ruined. <i>Now I've ruined your essay!</i> she cried out ecstatically, whereupon she ran to the window and shouted out this diabolical statement several times. <i>Now I've ruined your essay! Now I've ruined your essay!</i> I was no match for such hideous surprise attacks. At table she destroyed every conversation as it was just beginning, merely by laughing suddenly or interjecting some impossibly stupid remark which had no bearing on the incipient conversation.</p><h2>The Utter Disaster on the Oregon Trail (Snake Country Series, Vol. 2)</h2><p>A vivid description of one of the most brutal and horrific clashes between Native Americans and pioneers on the Oregon Trail.</p><p></p><h2>The Fifth Day of Christmas (The Best of Betty Neels)</h2><p><br><br>It hadn't taken Julia Pennyfeather long to fall in love with Ivo van den Werff.<br><br>But as soon as she met Marcia Jason she realized she had to fall out of love just as quickly.

When archaeologist Nina Wilde and her husband, ex-SAS soldier Eddie Chase, are given the chance to work on an Interpol investigation into smuggled artefacts, they are stunned to realise that the artefacts hold clues to the location of a lost Inca settlement hidden somewhere in South America. As Nina and Eddie dig deeper, it soon becomes clear that finding the settlement may only be the start of their incredible quest. One which, astonishingly, may lead them to one of the greatest legends of all time: El Dorado - the mythical city of gold. Nina and Eddie are desperate to locate the fabled city. But they are not alone in their search. Deep in the jungles of Venezuela, they face corrupt soldiers, murderous revolutionaries and ruthless drug lords who will stop at nothing to obtain the city&#39;s treasures. With so much at stake, what price will they pay for the greatest of fortunes?</p><p>Andy McDermott works as a freelance writer &#39;and occasional cartoonist&#39; and in a previous incarnation was magazine editor for, amongst others, DVD Review and the iconoclastic film magazine Hotdog. Andy was born in West Yorkshire.ONE<br><br>New York City<br><br>Eleven Years Later<br><br>Eddie Chase strolled into the office with his hands behind his back and a knowing smile on his face. &#x201c;Ay up, love.&#x201d;<br><br>His wife looked up from her laptop with a faint frown. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;ve you been?&#x201d; asked Nina Wilde, flicking a strand of red hair away from her face. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to be late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve still got ten minutes. Anyway, I&#x2019;m amazed you noticed I was gone, since you haven&#x2019;t lifted your nose out of that lot all morning.&#x201d; He glanced at the stacked paperwork on her desk.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a smart-�ass.&#x201d; She eyed him more closely, noticing his expectant smirk. &#x201c;What have you got behind your back?&#x201d;<br><br>He stepped forward. &#x201c;Oh, nothing. Just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; With a flourish, he dropped a large brown paper bag beside her computer. &#x201c;Lunch.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina did a double-�take as she recognized the logo on the bag. &#x201c;Aldo&#x2019;s Deli?&#x201d; Her frown was replaced by surprised delight. &#x201c;Wait, you went all the way to Aldo&#x2019;s just to get me a sandwich?&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie shrugged, looking out at the view of Manhattan beyond the windows of the United Nations Building. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only in the East Village. It&#x2019;s not that far.&#x201d;<br><br>She opened the bag, and her look brightened still further. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I did. Your favorite. Extra-�peppered pastrami on rye, with lettuce, tomatoes, pickled onions, not regular ones&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and Aldo&#x2019;s special chili sauce. Just like you used to get when we lived down there.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina almost reverently unwrapped the sandwich. &#x201c;That was over four years ago. I can&#x2019;t believe you did this.&#x201d; She was about to take a bite when she paused. &#x201c;Why did you do this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What, a bloke can&#x2019;t do something nice for his wife once in awhile?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not when she knows him as well as I know you.&#x201d; A sly smile. &#x201c;This wouldn&#x2019;t be a peace offering, would it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pfft, don&#x2019;t be daft. What&#x2019;ve I got to apologize for? I&#x2019;m right.&#x201d;<br><br>Her green eyes narrowed, the smile fading. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even start.&#x201d; A discussion the previous night about the week&#x2019;s main news story had somehow degenerated into a full-�blown argument, and the atmosphere had still been frosty even over breakfast. A New Yorker named Jerry Rosenthal was on trial for having killed the man accused of raping his daughter after the case against him collapsed. To Nina it had been an open-�and-�shut case of revenge-�driven vigilantism, but Eddie had very different opinions.<br><br>Which he still held. &#x201c;What, so you&#x2019;re saying that if it had been your daughter, you&#x2019;d be happy to let the guy walk the streets because of some forensics cock-�up? We know he did it, he just got away with it on a technicality.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know he did it,&#x201d; she said irritably. &#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t there&#x2014;�you didn&#x2019;t see what happened.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Neither did you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which is why we have courts to decide whether a person&#x2019;s guilty or not. And why we have courts to decide on the sentence&#x2014;�rather than some guy appointing himself judge, jury, and executioner. That&#x2019;s not justice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sounds like it to me. You know somebody&#x2019;s done something bad and thinks they&#x2019;ve got away with it? Boom. Kill the fucker.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina huffed. &#x201c;Eddie, I really don&#x2019;t want to get into this again. You know what? I&#x2019;m just going to eat my sandwich&#x2014;�for which thank you very much, by the way. And,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;you are not going to get the last word just because my mouth&#x2019;s full!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As if I would,&#x201d; said Eddie, who had been planning to do exactly that.<br><br>She was about to take a bite when there was a knock at the door. Before she could ask who it was, Macy Sharif entered. &#x201c;Hey, Nina. Hi, Eddie.&#x201d; The archaeology student, who had helped them discover the Pyramid of Osiris beneath the Egyptian desert the previous year, had accepted Nina&#x2019;s invitation to spend part of her summer vacation as an intern at the International Heritage Agency before completing her final year of study. &#x201c;Dr. Bellfriar sent me to get you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bet I know what he&#x2019;s going to say,&#x201d; said Eddie <br>with a mocking grin. &#x201c;Eight months of looking at the things, and he&#x2019;ll tell us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they&#x2019;re made of stone. Thank you, that&#x2019;ll be fifty grand plus expenses.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, he&#x2019;s got way more to say than that,&#x201d; said Macy, the Englishman&#x2019;s sarcasm fluttering past her unnoticed. &#x201c;I should know. I had to make all his PowerPoint slides.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not enjoying your current assignment?&#x201d; Nina asked in an impish tone.<br><br>&#x201c;No, no, it&#x2019;s fine!&#x201d; said Macy hurriedly. &#x201c;Just that I was hoping to do something a bit more fieldworky. With you.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina patted one of the stacks of documents. &#x201c;Funny, I was hoping to do some fieldwork too! But then some idiot tried to kill a bunch of world leaders, and we made a find that changes the face of archaeology, and, well, high-�up people want to know about it. In triplicate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe Bellfriar&#x2019;s found something that&#x2019;ll give you an excuse,&#x201d; Eddie suggested.<br><br>Nina looked hopefully at Macy, who tried unsuccessfully to hide a doubtful expression. &#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; said the young woman, &#x201c;you can see for yourself. He&#x2019;s with Mr. Penrose and the others in the conference room.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina took a quick bite from her sandwich before getting up from her desk. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; she asked Eddie as she chewed. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had lunch yet; I&#x2019;m hungry. Come on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do I have to?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If I do, so do you.&#x201d; She shooed him from the office.<br><br>Macy led the way to the conference room. As well as Dr. Donald Bellfriar, also present were several United Nations officials headed by Sebastian Penrose, who acted as liaison between the UN proper and its semi-�independent cultural protection agency. &#x201c;Ah, hello, Nina,&#x201d; said the bespectacled, officious Englishman.<br><br>&#x201c;Sebastian,&#x201d; Nina replied. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t expect so many people.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Everyone loves a mystery,&#x201d; Penrose said. &#x201c;I think they&#x2019;re hoping Dr. Bellfriar has the solution.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina shared a knowing look with Macy. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find out soon enough.&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone took their seats, Macy working a laptop and projector as the Oregonian geologist carefully smoothed his sweeping silver hair before addressing his audience. &#x201c;Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, I&#x2019;d like to say how great it&#x2019;s been to work with the IHA on this. I suppose that when archaeology can&#x2019;t provide the answers, it&#x2019;s time to call on the rock stars!&#x201d; He chuckled immodestly at his pun, which was received with appropriately stony silence. &#x201c;Rock stars? No? Anyway, thank you, Dr. Wilde&#x2014;�and thank you, Miss Sharif, for all your assistance. And for being enjoyable company.&#x201d; Macy beamed.<br><br>&#x201c;He was probably enjoying the view more than the conversation,&#x201d; Eddie whispered to Nina.<br><br>&#x201c;Shush,&#x201d; she whispered back, although he had a point. While Macy had spent her internship modestly dressed by her standards, in the formal surroundings of the UN the beautiful Miamian&#x2019;s predilection for tight designer clothing made her stand out like a bikini model in a Saudi mosque.<br><br>Bellfriar began his presentation proper, opening a case to reveal his subjects: a pair of small statues, crude human figures carved from an odd purple stone. The first had been found by Nina, Eddie, and Macy inside the Pyramid of Osiris; the second, stored with stolen cultural treasures in a former Cold War bunker beneath the glacial ice of Greenland. He summarized the circumstances of each discovery before continuing: &#x201c;Now, despite their best efforts, Interpol have so far been unable to find <br>out where the second statue was stolen from, and since <br>neither relic appears to be the product of any known <br>ancient culture, that would seem to be a dead end in <br>the search for answers. Fortunately, other branches of science can provide a different perspective. Miss Sharif?&#x201d;<br><br>Macy tapped at the laptop, projecting the first slide onto the conference room&#x2019;s screen. It showed the two statues placed side by side. &#x201c;As you can see,&#x201d; said Bellfriar, &#x201c;the statues are clearly part of a set, and meant to fit together. Note how the arms are positioned so they&#x2019;ll interlock. But as you see here&#x201d;&#x2014;�he nodded, and Macy clicked to the next slide&#x2014;�&#x201c;it&#x2019;s obvious that the set is incomplete.&#x201d;<br><br>The new image showed the statues from directly above. They had been positioned in such a way that, facing outward with one shoulder touching, they formed two sides of a triangle&#x2014;�and, as Bellfriar had said, it was evident that a third figurine would perfectly complete the group. &#x201c;Using simulation software,&#x201d; said the geologist proudly, &#x201c;I can show you what the missing one would look like.&#x201d; Another slide, and the two statues were shown flanking a computer-�generated image of a third. All three were broadly similar, the only appreciable difference being the position of the arms. &#x201c;And here&#x2019;s how they fit together&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br>The photos of the figures were replaced by CG copies that began a showy animated display, spinning around one another before slotting into a shoulder-�to-�shoulder triptych. The UN observers seemed impressed, but Nina was less so, having seen the IHA&#x2019;s own computer simulation of the missing figure over seven months earlier. &#x201c;That was one of the first things we realized when we received the second statue,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;There was&#x2014;�and hopefully still is&#x2014;�a third. The question is, where?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, before we can ask where,&#x201d; said Bellfriar amiably, &#x201c;we first have to ask what. As in, what are the statues made of?&#x201d; He indicated the two figures in the case. &#x201c;As you see, they have an unusual color, this strong purple, with a rather vitreous luster. Some form of bornite was my first thought, but the copper content in the scrape sample I took was far too low&#x2014;�almost nonexistent, in fact. But the density of the rock was surprisingly high, so it had an appreciable metal content&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina glanced at Eddie as Bellfriar launched into a detailed account of his mineralogical tests. His eyes had glazed over. She tapped his foot with hers. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;Geology&#x2019;s even more boring than archaeology.&#x201d;<br><br>She was about to jab his foot again, this time with her high heel rather than her toe, when Bellfriar&#x2019;s words caught her full attention. &#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which brought me to my conclusion: The rock from which the statues were carved was probably mesosideritic.&#x201d;<br><br>It took a moment, but the term produced a match from Nina&#x2019;s mental database. &#x201c;A meteorite?&#x201d;<br><br>Bellfriar was impressed. &#x201c;You know about meteorites, Dr. Wilde?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;From an archaeological standpoint. There was a dagger made from meteoric iron in Tutankhamen&#x2019;s tomb, and some Inuit and Native American tribes also made ceremonial weapons from it. And there was an East African tribe that worshipped a fallen meteorite. But apart from that, only really what I remember from Astronomy 101.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I can give you a brief refresher course,&#x201d; said Bellfriar, chuckling again. &#x201c;A mesosiderite is a stony-�iron meteorite, which as the name suggests is made up of a combination of rock and metal. They&#x2019;re very rare&#x2014;�there are fewer than a hundred and fifty known examples, I believe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You said it&#x2019;s probably a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a mesosiderite,&#x201d; said Penrose, almost stumbling over the word. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you be sure?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not without cutting one of the statues in two to make a microscope slide, and I doubt Dr. Wilde&#x2014;�or the Egyptian government&#x2014;�would be happy about that! But the tests I could do seemed reasonably conclusive. Although,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;if there&#x2019;s any way at all I could get a larger sample, I&#x2019;d very much like to carry out further tests. The rock has some unusual properties.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In what way?&#x201d; asked Nina.<br><br>&#x201c;The density, for one thing&#x2014;�either the iron content is much higher than I&#x2019;d expect, or there are heavier metals in there as well. There are also traces of organic compounds.&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie gave the statues a deeply suspicious look. &#x201c;Wait, there was something alive inside the meteor? Like the Blob?&#x201d;<br><br>Bellfriar laughed. &#x201c;No, no. If a compound is &#x2018;organic,&#x2019; then chemically it just means it contains carbon. Meteorites might have carried the precursors of life to earth, though; there was a famous find in Australia, the Murchison meteorite, which contained amino acids. I don&#x2019;t know if that was the case here&#x2014;�but I did notice something else.&#x201d; He turned to Macy. &#x201c;Miss Sharif, can you skip forward to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think slide seventeen?&#x201d;<br><br>Macy tapped the keyboard. Slides flashed on the screen, stopping at an image of one statue&#x2019;s surface taken through a microscope. At extreme magnification, the stone was a fractal microcosm of a rocky landscape, with what seemed almost like man-�made features running through it: a fine grid-�like pattern.<br><br>&#x201c;Looks like a developer&#x2019;s laying the ground for a new subdivision,&#x201d; said Nina.<br><br>&#x201c;It does, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; replied Bellfriar. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t want to live there, though&#x2014;�not a lot of space. The lines are only about fifty micrometers apart, less than the width of a human hair.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Eddie asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Some kind of carbon matrix infused into the meteoric iron. Naturally formed, of course&#x2014;�it looks artificial, but on this scale so do a lot of processes. What&#x2019;s interesting is that it&#x2019;s greatly increased the hardness of the rock, as if the whole thing has been reinforced with carbon nanotubes. Normally, this kind of stone would be around a five or six on the Mohs scale&#x2014;�diamond tops the scale at ten, by the way,&#x201d; he added for the benefit of the nonscientists. &#x201c;The statues are actually harder than the porcelain streak plate I initially tried to use to test them, so on the Mohs scale they&#x2019;re at least a seven&#x2014;�stronger than quartz.&#x201d;<br><br>His description had sparked another of Nina&#x2019;s memories&#x2014;�this time from personal experience. &#x201c;The rock,&#x201d; she began, her cautious, probing tone immediately catching Eddie&#x2019;s attention, &#x201c;does it have any other unusual properties? Like, say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. high electrical conductivity?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Actually, yes,&#x201d; said Bellfriar, surprised. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s due to the iron content, of course, but it was higher than I expected. How did you know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It just reminded me of something I&#x2019;d seen before,&#x201d; she said casually. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not important. What else have you found out?&#x201d;<br><br>Bellfriar returned to his presentation, but Nina was no longer listening, instead running through theories of her own. When he finished, twenty minutes later, she thanked him for his work, then waited for the United Nations officials to conclude their pleasantries, trying not to seem too eager for everyone to leave.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; whispered Eddie.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you in private,&#x201d; she murmured before calling across the room, &#x201c;Macy?&#x201d;<br><br>Macy was shutting down the laptop. &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can you take the statues to my office, please?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Taking them back off me so quickly, Dr. Wilde?&#x201d; said Bellfriar in jovial mock offense. &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re not disappointed that I didn&#x2019;t pinpoint where they came from?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, not at all,&#x201d; Nina told him as the puzzled Macy closed the case containing the statues. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve given me a lot to think about. Oh, Sebastian,&#x201d; she added as Penrose was about to leave, &#x201c;can I have a quick word with you? We need to finalize the details of, uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Atlantis excavations.&#x201d;<br><br>Penrose covered his momentary confusion&#x2014;�the IHA&#x2019;s undersea archaeological work at the ruins of Atlantis was already under way&#x2014;�and nodded as he left.

This latest volume in the Vegetarian Table series features delectable fare from one of the world's most popular cuisines.<p>Visit kittymorse.com!</p></p><p>Kitty Morse grew up in Casablanca, and through her extensive network of family and friends, she accumulated expertise in the cuisine of the entire Maghreb: Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. In this part of the world, banquets called <i>diffas</i> are long affairs which include heaping platters of couscous, aromatic tagines or stews, and exquisitely spiced dishes like feather-light Bisteya, a kind of pie often filled with pigeon. Meat, fish, and poultry are eaten, but most of the time, meals center on legumes like lentils, grains, and heaps of vegetables. Some of these dishes require seasoning with preserved lemons, fiery harissa, or a Tunisian blend of ground coriander, caraway, garlic, and chili powder which is called Tabil. Morse opens by showing how to make them all. There are recipes for a meatless Harira, a delightful Cauliflower and Zucchini Salad, and Tunisian Mechwya. There are also grilled peppers, several crustless Tunisian quiches, Foul Mudamus, a stew of fava beans with olives, plus a variety of couscous dishes and breads. Vegetarians will appreciate the complex flavors and brilliant colors of North African food. Those who eat meat will not miss it, thanks to the rich aromas and satisfying heft of Morse's dishes. Photos by Deborah Jones display the beauty of this traditional cooking. Menus will help you organize memorable meals, and mail-order sources can supply needed ingredients wherever you live. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i>Kitty Morse was born in Casablanca.

Lee's sequel to <i>Black Unicorn</i> (1991) continues the adventures of 16-year-old Tanaquil, runaway daughter of an idiosyncratic sorceress. Here, the young mender and her familiar, a spirited, intelligent peeve, are taken captive by a band of soldiers that is part of the army of Empress Veriam, who is intent upon conquering the world and rendering it "perfect," with a law for everything. To Tanaquil's complete astonishment, the empress, rumored "conqueror and child-eater," is her 16-year-old, half-sister, Lizra. To further her cause, Lizra has had constructed a huge, mechanical, gold-plated unicorn as a symbol of her power, but the unicorn doesn't work, and Lizra bades Tanaquil to mend it. A great part of the story follows the advancing army as it pursues the conquering of all the lands. However, the unicorn turns out to be far more than a machine of war; it proves to be a gate to an alternate world, where war is king and the fallen rise on the morrow to fight yet again. Although the story drags in places as the empress wages war, the scenes in the alternate, <i>Inferno</i>-like world are mesmerizing and scary; there is enough humor to leaven the whole, and the conclusion is open to yet another sequel. Not a starting place but an appealing story for readers of the first fantasy. <i>Sally Estes</i>Grade 6-10?In this sequel to Black Unicorn (Atheneum, 1991), readers rejoin Tanaquil after a year of travel has broadened her knowledge of the world and of herself. Coming to terms with her gift for sorcery, the teen finds herself in the midst of a war between a conquering Empress and the lands she is besieging. The Empress, who turns out to be Tanaquil's misguided half-sister, has built a mechanical golden unicorn. Tanaquil senses its evil nature but cannot deny her gift; she breathes "life" into it, only to find that she has helped create a war machine. The plot then follows the golden beast into war, eventually leading Tanaquil into an unpleasant alternate world that is virtually the opposite of the perfect world she had discovered in the previous book. This novel is not as captivating or as smoothly constructed as the first one. However, readers who enjoyed that title will want to continue following the heroine's adventures, and Lee does introduce some new and interesting characters. Although the immediate conflicts are resolved, there is definitely room for a third volume. A foreword summarizes Black Unicorn.?Susan L.

In the Chateau de Cirey, the two brilliant intellects scandalised the French aristocracy with their passionate love affair and provoked revolutions both political and scientific with their groundbreaking work in literature, philosophy and physics. Nancy Mitford&#39;s account of the love affair of the Enlightenment is, in the author&#39;s own words, &#39;a shriek from beginning to end&#39;.</p><p>Nancy Mitford was born in London on November 28 1904, daughter of the second Baron Redesdale, and the eldest of six girls. Her sisters included Lady Diana Mosley; Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire and Jessica, who immortalised the Mitford family in her autobiography Hons and Rebels. The Mitford sisters came of age during the Roaring Twenties and wartime in London, and were well known for their beauty, upper-class bohemianism or political allegiances. Nancy contributed columns to The Lady and the Sunday Times, as well as writing a series of popular novels including The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, which detailed the high-society affairs of the six Radlett sisters. While working in London during the Blitz, Nancy met and fell in love with Gaston Palewski, General de Gaulle&#39;s chief of staff, and eventually moved to Paris to be near him. In the 1950s she began writing historical biographies - her life of Louis XIV, The Sun King, became an international bestseller. Nancy completed her last book, Frederick the Great, before she died of Hodgkin&#39;s disease on 30 June 1973.&#34;Mitford writes with a profound sympathy for the 17th and 18th century, and Voltaire in Love caps her career as the nonpareil popular biographer of that era&#34; * Washington Post * &#34;One of the most blissfully entertaining books in our language&#34; * New Yorker * &#34;Nancy Mitford softened the image of the leader of the French Enlightenment with a witty little book called Voltaire in Love.

One of history's greatest artists, we are often told, had a special affinity for Judaism. With so many of Rembrandt's works devoted to stories of the Hebrew Bible, and with his apparent penchant for Jewish themes and the sympathetic portrayal of Jewish faces, it is no wonder that the myth has endured for centuries.<br><br><i>Rembrandt's Jews</i> puts this myth to the test as it examines both the legend and the reality of Rembrandt's relationship to Jews and Judaism. In his elegantly written and engrossing tour of Jewish Amsterdam&#x2014;which begins in 1653 as workers are repairing Rembrandt's Portuguese-Jewish neighbor's house and completely disrupting the artist's life and livelihood&#x2014;Steven Nadler tells us the stories of the artist's portraits of Jewish sitters, of his mundane and often contentious dealings with his neighbors in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam, and of the tolerant setting that city provided for Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews fleeing persecution in other parts of Europe. As Nadler shows, Rembrandt was only one of a number of prominent seventeenth-century Dutch painters and draftsmen who found inspiration in Jewish subjects. Looking at other artists, such as the landscape painter Jacob van Ruisdael and Emmanuel de Witte, a celebrated painter of architectural interiors, Nadler is able to build a deep and complex account of the remarkable relationship between Dutch and Jewish cultures in the period, evidenced in the dispassionate, even ordinary ways in which Jews and their religion are represented&#x2014;far from the demonization and grotesque caricatures, the iconography of the outsider, so often found in depictions of Jews during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.<br><br>Through his close look at paintings, etchings, and drawings; in his discussion of intellectual and social life during the Dutch Golden Age; and even through his own travels in pursuit of his subject, Nadler takes the reader through Jewish Amsterdam then and now&#x2014;a trip that, under ever-threatening Dutch skies, is full of colorful and eccentric personalities, fiery debates, and magnificent art.</p><p><b>Steven Nadler</b> is a professor of philosophy and director of the George L. Mosse/Laurence A. Weinstein Center for Jewish Studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He is the author, most recently, of <i>Spinoza: A Life</i>, which won the 2000 Koret Jewish Book Award for biography, and <i>Spinoza's Heresy: Immortality and the Jewish Mind</i>.Seventeenth-century Amsterdam was home to a remarkable Jewish community unique in all of Europe. Nadler has made this intriguing world his specialty, first in his acclaimed <i>Spinoza: A Life</i> (1999), and now in this enlightening inquiry into the depiction of Jews in Dutch art. Using Rembrandt's profoundly human portraits of his Jewish neighbors and depictions of Old Testament stories as his base, Nadler elucidates both the inner dynamics of Jewish Amsterdam and its interactions with the city at large. Rembrandt was not alone in his interest in Jewish life, and Nadler's disquisition on why Dutch theologians studied Judaica, and on why Dutch artists eschewed the blatant anti-Semitism found elsewhere in Europe, is profoundly intriguing. Nadler portrays both Rembrandt and Menasseh ben Israel, a friend of the artist whom Nadler believes was a crucial resource for Rembrandt's knowledge of Jewish culture and possibly "the most famous Jew in all of Europe." Rich in compelling detail and surprising disclosures, Nadler's discourse greatly deepens our understanding of the role of art in both Dutch and Jewish history. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

George Lucas made his world so believable and compelling by getting all the little things right, whether it was a chip in Vader's helmet or the sand on a Stormtrooper's boots. Of course, this feat was no accident--extensive conceptual planning and design went into all the <i>Star Wars</i> movies, perhaps most so for <i>Episode I: The Phantom Menace</i>. This excellent "insider story" art book by <i>Phantom Menace</i> researcher Jonathan Bresman pulls together a wealth of these preliminary paintings, sketches, and computer animatics. Starting in early 1995, the <i>Episode I</i> art team sweated out nearly four years in a renovated attic at Skywalker Ranch, and Bresman's book gives an eye-popping account of their efforts, a sweeping survey of the movie's "evolutionary record," what Bresman calls "the unseen art that serves as the foundation for the film."<p> Divided into sections covering each of the movie's major locales (e.g., Theed, Coruscant, Otoh Gunga), <i>The Art of Phantom Menace</i> gives detailed illustrations of many of the creatures, structures, and vessels that made the final cut to film. But even more interesting are those that never left the sketchbook or hard drive--what fan wouldn't want to see a bulky, bipedal droideka or Padm�'s horned, reptilian "swamp horse"? Call-outs alongside the art reveal the untold story behind many characters, like how Jedi Council member Yaddle really did begin as a sketch of a young Yoda, and how Jar Jar at one point had a wacky "dog" sidekick named Blarf.

Was he drunk to boot? He greeted his new assistant with "What are you drinking?" Yes, he was drunk. <br><br> Charlie Harmon was hired to manage the day-to-day parts of Bernstein's life. There was one additional responsibility: make sure Bernstein met the deadline for an opera commission. But things kept getting in the way: the centenary of Igor Stravinsky, intestinal parasites picked up in Mexico, teaching all summer in Los Angeles, a baker's dozen of young men, plus depression, exhaustion, insomnia, and cut-throat games of anagrams. Did the opera get written?<br><br>For four years, Charlie saw Bernstein every day, as his social director, gatekeeper, valet, music copyist, and itinerant orchestra librarian. He packed (and unpacked) Bernstein's umpteen pieces of luggage, got the Maestro to his concerts, kept him occupied changing planes in Zurich, Anchorage, Tokyo, or Madrid, and learned how to make small talk with mayors, ambassadors, a chancellor, a queen, and a Hollywood legend or two. How could anyone absorb all those people and places? Because there was music: late-night piano duets, or the Maestro's command to accompany an audition, or, by the way, the greatest orchestras in the world. Charlie did it, and this is what it was like, told for the first time.</p><p>Charlie Harmon is a music editor and arranger. From 1989 to 1999 he was the music editor for the estate of Leonard Bernstein, editing the first publications of full scores of <i>West Side Story</i> and <i>Candide</i>, and piano-vocals of <i>On the Town</i> and <i>Wonderful Town</i>, as well as new editions of <i>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue</i> and <i>Mass</i> (all music by Leonard Bernstein). He has also worked in the orchestra libraries of the New York Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic, the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Now a freelance editor, he lives in Florida.It is a truth universally acknowledged, that every writer dreams of an ideal reader. Two very real readers volunteered for that role, relieving me of my daydreams: Henry Adams, who knew nothing of my four years as Bernstein&#x2019;s assistant, and David Thomas, who knew everything, but from a tangential slant. My thanks to Henry and David for steering me toward the better word, the consistent voice, and the honest examination of these four peculiar years. <br> Though he wrote the definitive Bernstein biography, Humphrey Burton said the cheeriest words imaginable, after seeing a few sample chapters: &#x201c;All this is new to me,&#x201d; what every memoirist wants to hear.

In this revised edition of <i>When the Game Stands Tall</i>, author Neil Hayes, who had unrestricted access to the De La Salle team, writes from the inside about the games, the players, and their visionary coach, Bob Ladouceur, who managed to amass the highest winning percentage in football history (.995) through standing for something greater than winning. The book, which also features interviews with major sports figures like Bill Walsh and John Gruden, is a revealing portrait of the coach who believed above all in instilling basic life skills where winning is not the goal, but merely the byproduct of playing the game.</p><p>The Streak had become a national story long before it ended in September 2004. In this revised paperback, Neil Hayes catches up on the lives of the main characters and takes readers through the final tumultuous year. What results is a timeless and inspirational story of struggle, tragedy, and triumph.</p></p><p><p><b>Neil Hayes</b> was a sportswriter at the <i>Contra Costa Times</i> in Walnut Creek, California, and the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> during a 26-year newspaper career. He wrote the script for the ESPN documentary <i>151: The Greatest Streak,</i> which was inspired by this book. He was also part of the creative team and an on-set consultant during the filming of the major motion picture based on this book. Hayes lives in the Chicago area with his wife, Charlee, their two children, Nick and Riley, and a pair of unruly dogs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bob Larson, the award-winning photographer, has been allowed behind the scenes access to De La Salle's program for more than ten years. He documented the team's national record setting 73rd consecutive victory as well as the school's 100th straight win. Larson also created a photo documentary of the 2002 season. His black and white photos evoke both the public spectacle and personal faces of De La Salle's intriguing 'Streak.'&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Madden, the legendary NFL broadcaster synonymous with football for millions of fans nationwide, has an ability to explain the game's finer points with an idiosyncratic sense of humor.

Bouncing on the clouds in my mind.</p><p>&#x201c;Wren . . . wake up, Wren.&#x201d;</p><p>Everything&#x2019;s cocoony. Drifty. The clouds are so soft.</p><p>&#x201c;Wren, come on. It&#x2019;s time to go.&#x201d;</p><p>Go? Go where? Who said that? I don&#x2019;t recognize his voice. I look around my cloud, but it&#x2019;s dark. Like a storm is coming.</p><p>Then thunder begins to roll. &#x201c;Wren!&#x201d;</p><p>I pull in, hunker down. Why is he on my cloud? &#x201c;Go away,&#x201d; I mumble through the rocks in my mouth. I need a drink. Maybe if I licked the cloud . . .</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s totally wasted, Mom.&#x201d;</p><p>Wait. That was Anabella. What&#x2019;s she doing on my cloud?</p><p>She was definitely not invited.</p><p>The narc.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t see her either, though. And now the cloud is rocking. Rocking and spinning.</p><p>&#x201c;Go back to bed,&#x201d; my mother whispers.</p><p>My mother? No! Not her, too!</p><p>A new voice struggles into the darkness. A small, sleepy voice. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;</p><p>It&#x2019;s Mo! My little buddy, my Mowgli, my Mo-bro! He can be on my cloud. Anytime! But . . . no . . . wait. First I have to hide some things. Quick. I need to hide some things.</p><p>&#x201c;Take Morris and get back to bed!&#x201d; my mother hisses.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re doing this,&#x201d; Anabella says.</p><p>&#x201c;Take your brother and go!&#x201d; my father commands.</p><p>My father?</p><p>Why am I even on this cloud? It&#x2019;s so crowded now. And dark. And rolling with thunder.</p><p>&#x201c;Wren! Wake up!&#x201d;</p><p>Who is that?</p><p>Light stabs my eyes as I peel them open. A man comes into focus. He&#x2019;s large. Standing over me. Wearing dark blue. With gold-embroidered shoulder patches.</p><p>A . . . a cop?</p><p>I sit up a little.</p><p>Yes, a cop.</p><p>He starts swaying. But . . . no, it&#x2019;s not him swaying. It&#x2019;s me. Or my bed. I grab for my trash can and puke.</p><p>My mind runs to Nico as my guts come up. Did he get busted? Is that why there&#x2019;s a cop here? Did they connect the dots?</p><p>I try to play it cool as I wipe off my mouth. &#x201c;Sorry. Flu.&#x201d;</p><p>That line&#x2019;s always worked before. But this is a cop, not my parents. And he&#x2019;s got that look.</p><p>He&#x2019;s not buying.</p><p>The clock digits are a bloody red: 3:47 a.m. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; I ask my doorway parents. &#x201c;Why is he here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s for your own good,&#x201d; my father says. His voice sounds icy. Hard. A freezer door slamming shut.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you walk?&#x201d; the cop asks.</p><p>I muster a sneer. &#x201c;Of course I can walk!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then get up and get dressed.&#x201d; He hands me jeans and a hoodie. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re coming with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What? Why?&#x201d; I look over, and one of my doorway parents has disappeared. &#x201c;Mom!&#x201d; I call. I can hear her crying her way down the hall. &#x201c;Mom! What is going on!&#x201d;</p><p>She doesn&#x2019;t answer me. Nobody answers me. I&#x2019;m shaky and cold and my head is pounding. There are handcuffs on the cop&#x2019;s belt. I&#x2019;ve heard they hurt, so I pull on the jeans and yank the hoodie on over the T-shirt I slept in. I feel haphazard. On the verge of puking again. And then I notice that my phone&#x2019;s gone.</p><p>Full-on panic floods over me. I scramble around inside the covers, under my pillow.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got your phone,&#x201d; my father says.</p><p>I am so busted.</p><p>&#x201c;Use the bathroom,&#x201d; the cop tells me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be in the car awhile.&#x201d;</p><p>When I come out, my father hands a duffel to the cop and turns to me. His lips are tight white threads across his face. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve tried everything, Wren.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re turning me over to the cops? MOM!&#x201d; I scream past him. &#x201c;MOM!&#x201d;</p><p>The cop grips my arm, and when I struggle to get free, he wrestles me down the hallway. I can hear my mother crying in the kitchen. &#x201c;MOM!&#x201d; I shriek. &#x201c;WHAT IS GOING ON? HELP ME!&#x201d;</p><p>My brother&#x2019;s voice seeps through Anabella&#x2019;s door, high-pitched and desperate. &#x201c;We have to help Wren!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mowgli!&#x201d; I call out. &#x201c;Mo-bro, help me!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you really that selfish?&#x201d; my dad says, his words singeing the space between us.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you doing this to me?&#x201d; I ask as the cop drags me through the house. We pass by the living room, pass by the piano, and now I&#x2019;m crying.</p><p>&#x201c;Because we&#x2019;re at our wits&#x2019; end,&#x201d; my father says. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve run out of options.&#x201d;</p><p>Then the cop&#x2019;s saying, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be in touch, Mr. Clemmens,&#x201d; and I&#x2019;m being hauled outside.</p><p>&#x201c;Daddy, please!&#x201d; I cry.</p><p>The door closes in my face.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;LL BE BETTER! I PROMISE!&#x201d;</p><p>But I&#x2019;m talking to wood.</p><p>Dead, heartless wood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The cop maneuvers me off the porch and out toward the street, where a black SUV is waiting. It has no police-force markings. Just sleek black, with tinted windows.<br><br>&#x201c;You an undercover narc?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>&#x201c;You worried about that?&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;At fourteen?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just answer me!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get in.&#x201d; He opens the door and points me to the far-back seats.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a woman behind the wheel. Blue uniform, gold patches, sunglasses.</p><p>In the middle of the night, she&#x2019;s wearing sunglasses.</p><p>&#x201c;Mornin&#x2019;, sunshine,&#x201d; she says, grinning over her shoulder at me.</p><p>I want to tell her to shut up, but I climb in back, hoping she&#x2019;ll give me some answers. &#x201c;Where we going?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Joel didn&#x2019;t tell you?&#x201d; she asks, looking at me through the rearview mirror.</p><p>So the narc has a name. Joel. &#x201c;You just told me more than I&#x2019;ve gotten out of anybody this whole time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; she says, and eyes Joel over her glasses. &#x201c;Classified?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Need-to-know basis,&#x201d; he says, shutting the door and sitting in the middle row. &#x201c;And what you need to know is she&#x2019;s coming off a high and hungover bad.&#x201d;</p><p>She hands him a barf bag, which gets relayed back to me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re stuck in what you&#x2019;re wearing for at least twelve,&#x201d; she says through the mirror. &#x201c;So I wouldn&#x2019;t mess &#x2019;em up if I were you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Twelve? Twelve what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hours, honey.&#x201d; She puts the SUV in drive and pulls forward. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in for a long day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Twelve hours! Where are we going?&#x201d;</p><p>She glances in the mirror. &#x201c;To LAX.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To the airport?&#x201d; I lunge for the door, but Joel swats me back.</p><p>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; he tells the driver. &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t need to know that.&#x201d; Then he turns on me like a big, angry bear. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get something straight,&#x201d; he growls. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in my legal custody. I&#x2019;m allowed to restrain you by force. I&#x2019;ve dealt with a lot bigger and badder than you, and I&#x2019;m not in the mood for attitude, runners, or whining. If you want to be handcuffed, just try that again. If not, sit down, strap in, and shut up.&#x201d;</p><p>He stares me down, and it doesn&#x2019;t take long. I slink back feeling sick, but in a totally different way.</p><p>My parents turned over legal custody?</p><p>Like, disowned me?</p><p>I look out the window. We&#x2019;ve already left our neighborhood and are speeding along Culver. The street is eerie without the usual traffic. It&#x2019;s misty nighttime, but there are so many lights along the road, it&#x2019;s like daylight. We drive past block after block of curving sidewalks lined with hedges and trees and long-leafed plants. Perfectly trimmed, always. When we moved here, that seemed nice. There weren&#x2019;t chain-link fences or alleyways scattered with trash. Everything was clean and green. And there was room. But we&#x2019;ve been living here over three years, and I still get turned around when I go more than a few blocks. Every neighborhood looks the same.</p><p>We stop at a red light near Nico&#x2019;s street, and I think about making a dive for it again. Joel&#x2019;s sitting sideways, and I can see that his eyes are closed. . . . The driver&#x2019;s looking straight ahead waiting for the light to change. . . . If I can get out, I can ditch them, easy. But . . . would Nico even help me? He&#x2019;s told me more than once that if I bring trouble, I&#x2019;m gone.</p><p>Suddenly Joel sticks his leg out. &#x201c;Down, girl,&#x201d; he snarls, eyes still closed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me cuff you.&#x201d;</p><p>How can he know what I&#x2019;m thinking? I slump back, feeling way out of my league.</p><p>We ramp up to the I-5 freeway and head north, all five lanes to ourselves. I&#x2019;m paying attention, trying to memorize how to get back to the neighborhood if I can get away.</p><p>I recognize the Costco turnoff, which normally takes twenty minutes of stop-and-go traffic to get to, and before I can believe it, we&#x2019;re long gone, passing signs for Disneyland.</p><p>My heart hurts, thinking about Disneyland. Thinking about my brother. He&#x2019;s never been Morris Lee Clemmens IV to me. He&#x2019;s always been Mo, Mo-bro, or Mowgli.</p><p>My little Jungle Book buddy.</p><p>What are they telling him about me?</p><p>Will he believe them?</p><p>And how could they do this to me? My own parents!</p><p>We fly past Disneyland, leave it behind. I hold my head. My heart aches. I can&#x2019;t seem to breathe.</p><p>How could they do this to me?</p></p><h2>Bride of the Water God 5</h2><p>With a jealous admirer and a bitter, powerful mother plotting behind his back, Habaek&#39;s controversial decision to return Soah to his magical kingdom has the elemental gods and goddesses in an uproar. Habaek, the moody water god who rescued Soah&#39;s village from famine and drought, is also dealing with a curse that turns him into a child during the day and reverts him to his true adult form at night. While some of the inhabitants of his domain are friendly to his human bride - and some are a bit too friendly - Habaek has kept his curse secret from Soah, who&#39;s become completely confused by all the attention and resentment her presence brings! When night falls, Habaek pretends to be the aloof, handsome god, Mui, whose irresistible charisma and flirtations with Soah have her thinking that she&#39;s about ready to cheat on her immature spouse. It may be about time for Habaek/Mui to come clean!

When a mightly horde of orcs threatened his lands, he united the tribes of men to stand against them at Black Fire Pass. He broke the siege of Middenheim and pushed back the forces of Chaos. And in defeating the great necromancer Nagash, he saved mankind, securing the future of the Empire and taking his first steps on the road to godhood. His deeds are legend.

This book offers a sampling of her acclaimed gardening columns from the London Observer, grouped here by the months of the year. Sackville-West covered everything from the genesis of her white and gray summer garden to humorous ways to ward off birds (including "potatoes stuck with pheasants' feathers"). She didn't mince words ("one of the secrets of good gardening is to remove, ruthlessly, any plant one does not like"), yet was a poet at heart ("The flowers of Magnolia grandiflora look like great white pigeons settling among dark leaves"). Her vivid prose and fresh insights into gardening make this book a delight for armchair and active gardeners alike. There are lovely color drawings of some plants that she mentions and color photographs of her award-winning gardens, which still thrive at her home, 500-year-old Sissinghurst Castle. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Shadowmagic Trilogy</h2><p><p>A Lord of the Rings for the 21st century.

When gold was discovered on Cherokee land in northern Georgia in 1828, the U.S. Government passed the Removal Act, and 18,000 Cherokees, along with other southern tribes--Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Creeks--were forcibly relocated to Oklahoma territory. Herded along under armed guard, they traveled in bitter cold weather and as many as a quarter died on what became known as "The Trail of Tears."<p>In powerful poetry of epic proportions, which Harold Bloom has called his best work, Smith paints a stark and vivid picture of this ordeal and its principal participants, among them Sequoyah, the inventor of the Cherokee alphabet, and Osceola, the Seminole chief.</p><br></p><p><p>William Jay Smith (born 22 April 1918) is an American poet. He was appointed the nineteenth Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress from 1968 to 1970.</p>Smith's sequence of moving, extraordinarily visual poems brings us to the heart of one of the nation's greatest tragedies and, many say, sins--the "removal" of the five civilized tribes, via the Trail of Tears, from their homelands in the eastern U.S. to the Oklahoma territory. Part Choctaw himself, Smith uses several different voices in the sequence, such as those of an old Choctaw on the trail, remembering the "buzzard man" who presided over funeral rites, while mourning the many who died without such appropriate ritual; the great Choctaw chief, Pushmataha, who traveled to Washington in a failed attempt to gain a hearing for his people; and artist Charles Banks Wilson, sketching the last of the purebloods in the melting pot of Oklahoma. Many of the poems appear in the book's signature stanza, a lopey, three-line, roughly pentametric form that sounds sometimes reportorial, sometimes Shakespearean, sometimes both at once. Moving, humane, unforgettable. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Later, in 1933, this first-hand account was offered to a larger public with an introduction by Maurice Garland Fulton, who lived for years among the scenes of Billy the Kid&#39;s wild career. While certain statements made in the book by Poe are controversial, his account is a valuable document for anyone interested in Billy the Kid. Sunstone Press is pleased to offer this complete reprint of the 1933 edition along with a new forward in its Southwest Heritage Series. John William Poe was born in 1850 and died in 1923. Early in his life he was impressed by the novels of Sir Walter Scott and developed a desire to seek adventures out West. After working as a farm hand, on a railroad construction crew, and a buffalo hunter, he wound his way into law enforcement and eventually became a deputy for Sheriff Pat Garrett. After the incident with Billy the Kid, Poe was elected sheriff of Lincoln County, New Mexico, married, and after retiring as a lawman, settled in Roswell, New Mexico where he was a businessman until his death.</p><p></p><h2>The Year&#39;s Best Horror 19</h2><p>A collection of horror stories features the work of such masters as Ramsey Campbell, David Drake, and Ed Gorman</p><p></p><h2>Jutland 1916 (Trade Editions)</h2><p>The only major fleet engagement of World War I (1914-1918), the Battle of Jutland (1916) has been surrounded by controversy ever since. The British public felt Admiral Jellicoe had failed &#x2013; a reaction rooted in a hundred years of the 'Nelson cult', a conviction that anything short of a Trafalgar-style annihilation was letting the side down. True, the German Fleet had sunk more ships and suffered fewer casualties, but the British had forced them to disengage and run for port and were still cruising off Denmark spoiling for a fight. This title recounts in detail how on an early summer's evening in 1916, the two fleets clashed head to head: the events that followed would spark a polemic that still rages today.</p><p>The Bringing History to Life collection is made up of Osprey&#39;s all-time favourite titles, re-released with striking new covers - selected titles also include visitor information sections.Charles London is a military writer of long-standing, with a particular interest in the Royal Navy in the Great War.

Because Matisse was so undogmatic in his wisdom he speaks persuasively to artist working in many different ways and in many different mediums. In fact, I think that for Matisse the ideal audience for his writings was one composed mainly of artist and students.</p><h2>The Horrors in the Haunted House Pop-Up Storybook</h2><p>Vengeful ghouls and friendly ghosts abound in this elaborate haunted house.

The Roman investigator, informer, and imperial spy's snappy patter, romantic leanings, strong sense of irony, and penchant for getting into interesting situations have won Lindsey Davis a growing number of fans. Flush with his earnings from an African adventure (<i>Two for the Lions</i>), Falco's just been rewarded for his service to the empire with an unusual bit of political patronage: he's been appointed to the largely ceremonial position of Procurator of the Sacred Poultry, meaning he's in charge of the care and feeding of a gaggle of sacred geese. This un-Falco-like upward mobility is an opportunity for Marcus to move his patrician wife, Helena Justina, and their toddler out of a tenement and into a home of their own. As much as Marcus scoffs at middle-class pretensions, he's not above leaving his seedy surroundings and providing his family with some of the finer things, if only to show his in-laws that he can. But when Helena's brother falls over a corpse that disappears before it can be identified, Falco tosses the geese some food and gets busy finding the connection between the dead man and a 6-year-old girl who's in line to be chosen as the new vestal virgin. That leads him into intrigue, danger, and a confrontation with a former vestal virgin that almost costs him his life. Well paced, with good dialogue, excellent plotting, and a cast of terrific characters surrounding Falco and Helena, including some familiar from earlier stories, <i>One Virgin Too Many</i> shows Davis in top form. Falco the family man is better company than ever. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>Lindsey Davis</b> is the author of the acclaimed historical novels <i>The Course of Honor</i> and <i>Rebels and Traitors</i>.

The centerpiece of the collection is his signature work, &#x201c;The Death and Life of Dith Pran,&#x201d; which appeared in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>. This became the foundation of Roland Joff�&#x2019;s acclaimed film <i>The Killing Fields</i> (1984), which explored the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia during the late 1970s.<br><br> Although Schanberg may be best known for his work on Cambodia, he also reported on the India-Pakistan war that ended Pakistan&#x2019;s brutal attempt to crush the Bangladesh freedom movement in the 1970s. His striking coverage of the Vietnam conflict recounts Hanoi&#x2019;s fierce offensive in 1972 that almost succeeded. Years later, citing official documents and other hard evidence that a large number of American POWs were never returned by Hanoi, Schanberg criticized the national press for ignoring these facts and called for Washington to release documents that had been covered up since 1973. As the media critic for the <i>Village Voice</i>, Schanberg offered a unique and searing viewpoint on Iraq, which he called America&#x2019;s &#x201c;strangest war.&#x201d; His criticism of the Bush administration&#x2019;s secrecy brings his war reportage into the present and presents a vigorous critique of what he considers a devious and destructive presidency. <i>Beyond the Killing Fields</i> is an important work by one of America&#x2019;s foremost journalists.</p><p>Sydney Schanberg was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his New York Times coverage of the fall of Cambodia to the Khmer Rouge in 1975. But his reporting on Cambodia is largely known from &#34;The Killing Fields,&#34; the Academy Award-winning film starring Sam Waterston as Schanberg, which was based on his New York Times article chronicling the search for his captured Cambodian colleague Dith Pran and Pran&#39;s escape to freedom in 1979.&#x201c;There is a biblical quality to this story. What you have in this book is a tremendous, bone-chilling piece of eyewitness war correspondence. What makes it truly extraordinary, however&#x2014;what makes it a transcendent and classic piece of war literature&#x2014;is the story of the survival of Dith Pran and the deepening affection between two men from different worlds. Caught up in a war in which the vile and inhuman have become commonplace, two men are reborn by discovering the depths of their own humanity. In the end, they have won a personal victory over war itself.&#x201d;&#x2014;Russell Baker, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, humorist, chronicler of American life, former columnist for the <i>New York Times</i>, and former host of <i>Masterpiece Theatre</i> (Russell Baker 2009-12-14)<br><br>&#x201c;I recommend reading this remarkable book all at once, as I did. You&#x2019;ll learn things. You&#x2019;ll be fascinated and moved. It puts the reader where the reporter was and leaves you with an indelible picture of war as it is. The past&#x2014;and the myriad, uncounted noncombatant victims of three wars&#x2014;are brought back to life. Sydney Schanberg&#x2019;s writing matches the intensity of the stories he has to tell and makes you feel the hurt. &#x2018;This is what it&#x2019;s like. Look,&#x2019; it says. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t look away.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s hard, necessary information.&#x201d;&#x2014;Sam Waterston, star of the long-running television drama <i>Law &amp; Order</i>, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Schanberg in <i>The Killing Fields</i> (Sam Waterston 2009-12-13)<br><br>&#x201c;Sydney Schanberg is one of the greatest war correspondents of the twentieth century. His passion for Cambodia is outweighed only by his passion for the truth and for his dear friend and colleague Dith Pran. This book is a chilling historical document that lyrically captures some of the darkest periods in American&#x2014;and human&#x2014;history. It is both great journalism and great art."&#x2014;David Rohde, two-time Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning reporter for the <i>New York Times</i> (David Rohde 2009-12-12)<br><br>&#x201c;A priceless collection of the war journalism of Syd Schanberg. Based in Southeast Asia, he was one of a tiny handful of reporters who remained behind to see the Khmer Rouge take over Phnom Penh and begin the Cambodian genocide. More recently, Schanberg's was among the few voices calling to account two U.S. senators, John McCain and John Kerry, both Vietnam veterans, for manipulating the findings of a special Senate committee to cover up the truth: that the Nixon White House, directed by President Nixon and his war planner, Henry Kissinger, left hundreds of living American POWs behind in the hands of their captors when we evacuated Vietnam. Schanberg's war writings offer lessons of great value in our conduct of today&#x2019;s wars without end. They remind us at once of bygone standards of journalistic excellence and the depths to which humanity can descend in times of war.&#x201d;&#x2014;Joseph L.

Declaring independence in 1945, Indonesia said it would &#x201c;work out the details of the transfer of power etc. as soon as possible.&#x201d; With over 300 ethnic groups spread across 13,500 islands, the world&#x2019;s fourth most populous nation has been working on that &#x201c;etc.&#x201d; ever since. Bewitched by Indonesia for twenty-five years, Elizabeth Pisani recently traveled 26,000 miles around the archipelago in search of the links that bind this impossibly disparate nation. Fearless and funny, Pisani shares her deck space with pigs and cows, bunks down in a sulfurous volcano, and takes tea with a corpse. Along the way, she observes Big Men with child brides, debates corruption and cannibalism, and ponders &#x201c;sticky&#x201d; traditions that cannot be erased. 25 illustrations</p><p>Elizabeth Pisani has lived in Indonesia at various times over the past twenty-five years, originally as a journalist and later as an HIV epidemiologist.

Wondrous gifts: the ability--with a glance, a gesture, a word--to summon animals, bring forth fire, move the land. Fearsome gifts: They can twist a limb, chain a mind, inflict a wasting illness. The Uplanders live in constant fear that one family might unleash its gift against another. Two young people, friends since childhood, decide not to use their gifts. One, a girl, refuses to bring animals to their death in the hunt. The other, a boy, wears a blindfold lest his eyes and his anger kill. In this beautifully crafted story, Ursula K. Le Guin writes of the proud cruelty of power, of how hard it is to grow up, and of how much harder still it is to find, in the world&#39;s darkness, gifts of light. (20040801)</p><p><b>URSULA K.

She lives in Portland, Oregon.<br>He was lost when he came to us, and I fear the silver spoons he stole from us didn't save him when he ran away and went up into the high domains. Yet in the end the lost man, the runaway man was our guide.<br><br> Gry called him the runaway man. When he first came, she was sure he'd done some terrible thing, a murder or a betrayal, and was escaping vengeance. What else would bring a Lowlander here, among us?<br><br> "Ignorance," I said. "He knows nothing of us. He's not afraid of us."<br><br> "He said people down there warned him not to come up among the witches."<br><br> "But he knows nothing about the gifts," I said. "It's all just talk, to him. Legends, lies..."<br><br> We were both right, no doubt. Certainly Emmon was running away, if only from a well-earned reputation for thievery, or from boredom; he was as restless, as fearless and inquisitive and inconsequential as a hound puppy, trotting wherever his nose led him. Recalling the accent and turns of speech he had, I know now that he came from far in the south, farther than Algalanda, where tales of the Uplands were just that-tales: old rumors of the distant northland, where wicked witchfolk lived in icy mountains and did impossible things.<br><br> If he'd believed what they told him down in Danner, he'd never have come up to Caspromant. If he'd believed us, he never would have gone on higher in the mountains. He loved to hear stories, so he listened to ours, but he didn't believe them. He was a city man, he'd had some education, he'd travelled the length of the Lowlands. He knew the world. Who were we, me and Gry? What did we know, a blind boy and a grim girl, sixteen years old, stuck in the superstition and squalor of the desolate hill farms that we so grandly called our domains? He led us on, in his lazy kindness, to talk about the great powers we had, but while we talked he was seeing the bare, hard way we lived, the cruel poverty, the cripples and backward people of the farms, seeing our ignorance of everything outside these dark hills, and saying to himself, Oh yes, what great powers they have, poor brats!<br><br> Gry and I feared that when he left us he went to Geremant. It is hard to think he may still be there, alive but a slave, with legs twisted like corkscrews, or his face made monstrous for Erroy's amusement, or his eyes truly blinded, as mine were not. For Erroy wouldn't have suffered his careless airs, his insolence, for an hour.<br><br> I took some pains to keep him away from my father when his tongue was flapping, but only because Canoc's patience was short and his mood dark, not because I feared he'd ever use his gift without good cause. In any case he paid little heed to Emmon or anyone else. Since my mother's death his mind was all given to grief and rage and rancor. He huddled over his pain, his longing for vengeance. Gry, who knew all the nests and eyries for miles around, once saw a carrion eagle brooding his pair of silvery, grotesque eaglets in a nest up on the Sheer, after a shepherd killed the mother bird who hunted for them both. So my father brooded and starved.<br><br> To Gry and me, Emmon was a treasure, a bright creature come into our gloom. He fed our hunger. For we were starving too.<br><br> He would never tell us enough about the Lowlands. He'd give an answer of some kind to every question I asked, but often a joking answer, evasive or merely vague. There was probably a good deal about his past life that he didn't want us to know, and anyhow he wasn't a keen observer and clear reporter, as Gry was when she was my eyes. She could describe exactly how the new bull calf looked, his bluish coat and knobby legs and little furry hornbuds, so that I could all but see him. But if I asked Emmon to tell about the city of Derris Water, all he said was that it wasn't much of a city and the market was dull. Yet I knew, because my mother had told me, that Derris Water had tall red houses and deep streets, that steps of slate led up from the docks and moorages where the river traffic came and went, that there was a market of birds, and a market of fish, and a market of spices and incense and honey, a market for old clothes and a market for new ones, and the great pottery fairs to which people came from all up and down the Trond River, even from the far shores of the ocean.<br><br> Maybe Emmon had had bad luck with his thieving in Derris Water.<br><br> Whatever the reason, he preferred to ask us the questions and sit back at ease to listen to us-to me, mostly. I was always a talker, if there was anybody to listen. Gry had a long habit of silence and watchfulness, but Emmon could draw her out.<br><br> I doubt he knew how lucky he'd been in finding us two, but he appreciated our making him welcome and keeping him comfortable through a bitter, rainy winter. He was sorry for us. He was bored, no doubt. He was inquisitive.<br><br> "So what is it this fellow up at Geremant does that's so fearsome?" he'd ask, his tone just skeptical enough that I'd try as hard as I could to convince him of the truth of what I said. But these were matters that were not much talked about, even among people with the gift. It seemed unnatural to speak of them aloud.<br><br> "The gift of that lineage is called the twisting," I said at last.<br><br> "Twisting? Like a sort of dancing?"<br><br> "No." The words were hard to find, and hard to say. "Twisting people."<br><br> "Making them turn around?"<br><br> "No. Their arms, legs. Necks. Bodies." I twisted my own body a bit with discomfort at the subject. Finally I said, "You saw old Gonnen, that woodsman, up over Knob Hill. We passed him yesterday on the cart road. Gry told you who he was."<br><br> "All bent over like a nutcracker."<br><br> "Brantor Erroy did that to him."<br><br> "Doubled him up like that? What for?"<br><br> "A punishment. The brantor said he came on him picking up wood in Gere Forest."<br><br> After a little, Emmon said, "Rheumatism will do that to a man."<br><br> "Gonnen was a young man then."<br><br> "So you don't yourself recall it happening."<br><br> "No," I said, vexed by his airy incredulity. "But he does. And my father does. Gonnen told him. Gonnen said he wasn't in Geremant at all, but only near the borderline, in our woods. Brantor Erroy saw him and shouted, and Gonnen was scared, and started to run away with the load of wood on his back. He fell. When he tried to stand, his back was bent over and hunched, the way it is now. If he tries to stand up, his wife said, he screams with the pain."<br><br> "And how did the brantor do this to him?"<br><br> Emmon had learned the word from us; he said he'd never heard it in the Lowlands. A brantor is the master or mistress of a domain, which is to say the chief and most gifted of a lineage. My father was Brantor of Caspromant. Gry's mother was Brantor of the Barres of Roddmant and her father Brantor of the Rodds of that domain. We two were their heirs, their nestling eaglets.<br><br> I hesitated to answer Emmon's question. His tone had not been mocking, but I didn't know if I should say anything at all about the powers of the gift.<br><br> Gry answered him. "He'd have looked at the man," she said in her quiet voice. In my blindness her voice always brought to me a sense of light air moving in the leaves of a tree. "And pointed his left hand or finger at him, and maybe said his name. And then he'd have said a word, or two, or more. And it was done."<br><br> "What kind of words?"<br><br> Gry was silent; maybe she shrugged. "The Gere gift's not mine," she said at last. "We don't know its ways."<br><br> "Ways?"<br><br> "The way a gift acts."<br><br> "Well, how does your gift act, what does it do, then?" Emmon asked her, not teasing, alive with curiosity. "It's something to do with hunting?"<br><br> "The Barre gift is calling," Gry said.<br><br> "Calling? What do you call?"<br><br> "Animals."<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Ursula K.

Since Soto himself was once a Mexican American teen growing up in Fresno, CA, he writes about subjects, settings, and situations with which he is intimately acquainted. Soto attended Fresno City College to avoid the 1970 draft. After completing two years, he transferred to California State University. Although he had no idea what he wanted to do, Soto wrote poetry while working many jobs and living at home. Soto says he first became interested in poetry when he discovered the works of poets of the &#x201c;Beat&#x201d; generation. After receiving his master&#x2019;s degree, Gary moved to Mexico City and later taught at several universities. He left teaching in 1991 to become a full-time writer. Soto now concentrates mainly on children&#x2019;s literature, but he still writes poetry for adults. Because his work has touched the lives of many Latino-American children, Soto feels very rewarded.</p><h2>The Federal Vision and Covenant Theology: A Comparative Analysis</h2><p>A comparative and critical study of &#34;Federal Vision&#34; that contrasts it with the concept of covenant theology.</p><p><b>Guy Prentiss Waters</b> (BA, University of Pennsylvania; MDiv, Westminster Theological Seminary; PhD, Duke University) is Professor of New Testament at Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi. At Duke, he studied under Richard B. Hays and E. P. Sanders, two leading expositors of the New Perspectives on Paul. Dr. Waters is the author of <i>Justification and the New Perspective on Paul: A Review and Response</i>. He is an ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church in America. He is also a member of the Society of Biblical Literature and the Institute of Biblical Research."Preferring light to heat, Waters has done an admirable job of allowing his interlocutors to speak for themselves. He offers clear-headed, exegetically grounded responses." --<b>Michael Horton</b><br><br>"Reformed pastors and interested lay people need the sober biblical analysis provided by this book, and Guy Waters is uniquely qualified to write it." --<b>Richard D. Phillips</b><br><br>"Thoroughly researched and clearly written. Waters deals fairly and charitably with the chief advocates and ideas of the 'Federal Vision.' He shows from their own writings how they have departed from the teaching of Scripture summarized in the Reformed confessions." --<b>Joel Beeke</b></p><h2>The Russian Moment in World History</h2><p><p>Is Russian history one big inevitable failure? The Soviet Union's demise and Russia's ensuing troubles have led many to wonder. But this is to look through a skewed prism indeed. In this provocative and elegantly written short history of Russia, Marshall Poe takes us well beyond the Soviet haze deep into the nation's fascinating--not at all inevitable, and in key respects remarkably successful--past.</p><br><p> Tracing Russia's course from its beginnings to the present day, Poe shows that Russia was the only non-Western power to defend itself against Western imperialism for centuries. It did so by building a powerful state that molded society to its military needs. Thus arose the only non-Western path to modern society--a unique path neither "European" nor "Asian" but, most aptly, "Russian."</p><br><p> From the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries, Russia prevailed despite unparalleled onslaughts by powerful Western armies. However, while Europe nurtured limited government, capitalism, and scientific and cultural revolution, early Russian society cultivated autocracy and command economics. Both Europe and Russia eventually created modern infrastructures, but the European model proved more productive and powerful. The post-World War I communist era can be seen as a natural continuation of Russia's autocratic past that, despite its tragic turns, kept Russia globally competitive for decades.</p><br><p> The Russian moment in world history thus began with its first confrontations with Europe in the fifteenth century, and ended in 1991 with the Soviet collapse. Written with verve and great insight, <i>The Russian Moment in World History</i> will be widely read and vigorously debated by those who seek a clear and unequivocal understanding of the complex history that has made Russia what it is today.</p></p><p><p>"This unique, interesting, and stimulating book shoehorns the whole of Russian history into a single long essay, one that is argued very forcefully and written with remarkable clarity and verve."--<b>Reginald Zelnik, University of California, Berkeley, author of <i>Law and Disorder on the Narova River</i></b></p><p>"This is a stimulating and timely essay, which, as intended, is provocative and potentially controversial at every turn."--<b>Simon Franklin, Clare College, University of Cambridge, coauthor of <i>The Emergence of Rus' 750-1200</i></b></p><b>Marshall T. Poe</b> is the author of several books on Russian history, including <i>A People Born to Slavery: Russia in Early Modern European Ethnography, 1476-1748</i>.

Stevie could see a group of young men in purple-and-white sweats coming through the doorway. &#x201c;Straight down this hall to the end and turn right gentlemen,&#x201d; someone they couldn&#x2019;t see was saying. &#x201c;Your locker room is the first one you come to on your right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As if they can&#x2019;t read the signs,&#x201d; Stevie said.<br><br>&#x201c;He must have forgotten that they&#x2019;re student-athletes,&#x201d; Susan Carol said.<br><br>Stevie laughed. He hated to admit it, but she was kind of funny.<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Should we head&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>She stopped in mid-sentence again. Stevie turned and saw one final purple-and-white suited player walk through the doorway, peering around as if to make sure no one was there. Stevie recognized the floppy blond hair right away. It was Chip Graber. Right behind him was a man in a charcoal gray suit who was also looking around in a suspicious way. Instinctively, Stevie took Susan Carol&#x2019;s arm and stepped back so they were hidden behind some rolled up Astroturf.<br><br>Graber and the charcoal suit finally seemed satisfied they were alone, then walked towards the loading dock until they were almost directly below Stevie and Susan Carol&#x2013;who were both frozen with surprise and curiosity.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, Chip, we&#x2019;ve got about two minutes to get this straight before the press conference,&#x201d; the suit said. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t get cold feet now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I never had warm feet,&#x201d; Chip Graber answered in a stage whisper, still plenty loud enough for Stevie and Susan Carol to hear. &#x201c;What if I won&#x2019;t do it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then the team gets stripped of all its wins and your father gets fired. We&#x2019;ve been through this. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>There was a long silence. Stevie wondered if perhaps the conversation had ended, but there were no signs of movement below. Susan Carol started to open her mouth to say something, but he put a finger to his lips to indicate she should stay silent.<br><br>Just when Stevie thought he was wrong, he heard Graber&#x2019;s voice again. &#x201c;This is unbelievable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Chip, the world&#x2019;s a cold place sometimes. Cooperate and you&#x2019;ll be a millionaire in a couple of months. Your dad will get a big contract extension for making the Final Four. Quit whining, do what you need to do, and we&#x2019;ll all walk away happy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But what if we lose Saturday? There&#x2019;s no guarantee we&#x2019;ll win that game. Why does it have to be Monday?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not something you need to worry about. You just play your butt off against St. Joe&#x2019;s and choke against Duke. We&#x2019;ll take care of the rest.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get you for this. All of you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Please. You don&#x2019;t even know who we are. And if you try anything with me, the roof will fall in on you and your dad. Now let&#x2019;s go. You&#x2019;ve got a press conference.&#x201d;<br><br>This time they could hear footsteps walking away. Stevie and Susan Carol stood stock still for a moment looking at one another.<br><br>&#x201c;What did we just hear?&#x201d; she asked finally.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, unless I&#x2019;m crazy, we just heard the best player in the country being blackmailed to throw the championship game.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s what I heard too. But he has to win tomorrow. Isn&#x2019;t that weird? I don&#x2019;t know very much about gambling, but if someone is trying to make a lot of money by betting against Minnesota State, why wait until Monday?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what Graber asked. There&#x2019;s got to be a reason why it has to be Monday. And he said he had to lose to Duke on Monday. How&#x2019;s he know Duke will win tomorrow?&#x201d;<br><br>For the first time since they had met that morning, Stevie thought Susan Carol looked lost. &#x201c;What do we do?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>Stevie shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Tell someone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But who?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;d believe us?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good question,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I barely believe us. Man, I wanted a story no one else had, but this is insane. Let&#x2019;s get out of here. It&#x2019;s spooky.&#x201d;<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t argue.<br><br>As they opened the doors that led back to the hallway and the bright lights hit Stevie&#x2019;s eyes, he felt like he was leaving a movie.

Rex</h2><p>Full-color photos and illustrations enhance this comprehensive, factual tale about the finding and displaying of the world&#39;s most complete T. Rex, which can now be seen at the Field Museum of Chicago.</p><p><p>Gr 5-8-The discovery of a nearly complete T. rex by an observant woman walking her dog on a late summer day in 1990 was the fossil find of a lifetime, but the subsequent brouhaha over its ownership put the "Bone Wars" of the 1800s in the shade. Lawsuits, court cases, and the ultimate auction of "Sue" brought this magnificent discovery to the front pages of major newspapers, made headlines on TV newscasts, and created a furor in the scientific world. This exciting re-creation of that find and the sensational commotion it caused is fleshed out as the full process of extracting such a monumental skeleton, preparing it, and mounting it for public display is recounted. Enriched with clear color photos and a brilliant painting showing Sue in all her fearsome reality, the lucid and lively text records the "resurrection" and the new data Sue and fossils in the surrounding matrix have brought to light. For those who enjoyed Jack Horner's fascinating Digging up Tyrannosaurus Rex (Crown, 1992), J. Lynette Gillette's dramatic The Search for Seismosaurus (Dial, 1994), and Don Lessem's intriguing Bigger Than T. Rex (Crown, 1997), this is a treasure. It's sure to have rex-philes wheedling for Chicago vacations, where Sue resides in massive grace in the Field Museum.-Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Gr. 3-6. Meet Sue, the largest and most complete <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i> skeleton ever found. This begins with Susan Hendrickson's discovery of the dinosaur in South Dakota in 1990, followed by the unearthing of the bones, and the fossil's arrival at the Field Museum in Chicago. In a 65-million-year flashback, readers learn about life in the late Cretaceous period, when Sue lived. The closing chapters explain how the fossilized bones were packed, transported, CT scanned, cleaned, repaired, copied, and mounted on a specially designed armature for museum display. Readers will get a real sense of the team effort that science can be. The text, written with the assistance of several paleontologists at the Field Museum, is lucid and engaging. It also clearly states that birds are reptiles ("Modern reptiles include crocodiles, turtles, snakes, lizards, and birds"), a statement that warrants additional explanation. Many color photographs, as well as diagrams and paintings, appear throughout the book to illustrate Sue's story. Dinosaur fans will be fascinated. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He had illegally set off into the universe, defying the laws of his now extinct people, the Time Lords, because he wanted to explore... to seek out... anything and everything.<br><br> He had experienced the extremes of existence. There had been so much terror, so much delight... and everything in between.<br><br> He had made so many friends, fought as many enemies. There had been beginnings and ends, joyous meetings, sad farewells.&nbsp; And it was all etched across the face of this man who had had many faces. The one, unchanging facet of his appearance&#x2014;the scope of his lives and deeds, there in his eyes. There, in the warmth of his ancient smile.<br><br> Even now, with the Doctor in his most outwardly youthful body, more than ever, there was something of the ancient about him. There was a weariness... Perhaps even a growing awareness of his place in all things, that made him concerned about the extent of the consequences of his wanderings.<br><br> Travelling alone now, he was intending to keep a low profile in the tracks of eternity. Those were his avowed, good intentions.<br><br> But the Doctor&#x2019;s Achilles heel was his curiosity. <br><br>Standing back from the console, exuding that pride in his own, latest adjustments, he caught sight of himself in the glass column ascending from the centre of the hexagonal console. The unmistakable signs of his ship&#x2019;s power were rising and falling encouragingly inside the glass. He beamed a broad smile at himself, tweaked his bow tie and smoothed down his tweed jacket.<br><br> &#x2018;Somewhere nice and quiet, I think,&#x2019; he said to his reflection.&nbsp; He twiddled his fingers, like a safe-cracker about to unlock a fortune. But before he could set a new course, something on one of the festooned hexagon&#x2019;s opposite surfaces bleeped.<br><br> A single, faint bleep. Then another. And another, until the bleeping became insistent, bordering on the downright irritating.<br><br> The Doctor had already circled the console and was anxiously inspecting the source of the bleeping. A blinking amber light.&nbsp; He frowned and tapped it. The bleeping and blinking continued.<br><br> &#x2018;Are you sure, old girl?&#x2019;&nbsp; he whispered, moving his ancient, youthful face closer and closer to the amber light.&nbsp; This was not a light he had ever thought to see blinking again. Then, suddenly, it stopped. No blinking. No bleeping.<br><br> &#x2018;Oh,&#x2019; said the Doctor. He felt a sudden pang of sadness; but it was only momentary, because the silence was soon broken by a very distinct tapping on the outer side of the TARDIS&#x2019;s wooden doors. Something was outside, in the surging Vortex, tapping on the TARDIS&#x2019;s outer dimensions.<br><br> Checking that the ship&#x2019;s force field was in place, the Doctor dashed from the console, down the steps to the rather quaint wooden doors set into the other-worldly architecture of the control room.&nbsp; He flung the doors open, and there, hovering before him was a small white, glowing cube.<br><br> &#x2018;Oh, you&#x2019;re just a baby one, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x2019; he said, beaming with his unique mix of surprise, delight and enthusiasm. In an instant, he had snatched the cube into his hands, thrown the doors shut and dashed back up the stairs to the controls. He held the cube in the light from the console, squinting, intrigued.<br><br> In dire emergencies, his people had used these strange, telepathic cubes to send messages. He had used one himself, many lifetimes ago &#x2013; and not so long ago, he had been lured into a trap by one. But this little &#x2018;fellow&#x2019; was a slightly different kettle of fish, he thought.<br><br> It was very small. About half the size of your standard Time Lord cube.<br><br> &#x2018;Looks like something I might have knocked up in a hurry,&#x2019; he said to himself. &#x2018;Ah!&#x2019;<br><br> And the thought hit him.<br><br> Or rather... the question. Was this one of those moments when something from his future had rocketed back into his past?<br><br> Time travel was fraught with these difficulties.&nbsp; He had no way of telling when and where the cube had come from just by looking at it. Best to press ahead and find out what this little messenger had to say to him, he thought.<br><br> Crouching down on the floor, with all the inelegance of a recently born gazelle, the Doctor placed the cube in front of him and began to concentrate his whole mind upon it. Would it work, he wondered? If it did, it would be a sure sign that he had indeed sent the message to himself.<br><br> At that precise moment, the cube unlocked itself and a fizz of sparkling, white energy rose from it. As the tiny walls fell gracefully apart and the cloud of particles dissipated, the Doctor&#x2019;s mind was filled with the impression of something...<br><br> Something...<br><br> He couldn&#x2019;t quite articulate the thought in his mind. All he knew was, he had to go to the console. He placed the opened pieces of the cube into his jacket pocket and jumped to his feet. His hands set to work, rapidly adjusting coordinates. The TARDIS was quick to respond, her engines groaning reassuringly.&nbsp; Moments later, they thudded to a halt.<br><br> The Doctor breathed a sigh of satisfaction. He patted the console and smiled.<br><br> &#x2018;Clever old thing. Well done.&#x2019;<br><br> He pulled the console&#x2019;s screen towards him, peering at the whirl of symbols and graphics on it. He&#x2019;d never been here before, he knew that. But he had heard the name of the place.<br><br> &#x2018;The planet Gethria,&#x2019; he mouthed to himself.<br><br> All the readings showed the planet could support a wide range of life forms, so he decided to go outside, pausing only briefly to activate the wall scanner to see what he could expect to be greeted with.&nbsp; He frowned as he saw the barren, desert landscape and some kind of gigantic,&nbsp;&nbsp; ancient stone monument.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard, grey, granite-like.&nbsp; Just below it, there was a small gathering of humanoids.<br><br> &#x2018;Bound to be friendly,&#x2019; he muttered, half-suspecting his optimism might be misplaced. <br><br>But the same kind of compulsion that had led him to set the coordinates for Gethria seemed to be driving him now.&nbsp; He was possessed of a feeling that he couldn&#x2019;t quite understand. He just knew he must set foot on this world.<br><br> The TARDIS had landed about half a mile away from the monument.&nbsp; This gave the Doctor plenty of time to survey the group of humanoids as he approached over the crumbling, dry surface of Gethria. He made no attempt to hide himself. He could, for example, have darted between rocky outcrops, alternately hiding and dashing for cover; but there was really no need, he thought.<br><br> The closer he got to the gathering, the more it became apparent to the Doctor that these people were not the slightest bit interested in anything&nbsp; other than whatever it was directly&nbsp; in front&nbsp; of them. He couldn&#x2019;t see what that was for now; but they were all staring down at it.<br><br> As he got ever closer, some indistinct words drifted across to him on the dry, dusty breeze. Although he couldn&#x2019;t quite make them out, they sounded sombre and respectful in tone.<br><br> And then, before he had reached the gathering, as if responding to some unspoken signal, the humanoids began to depart, walking slowly, heads bowed, around the monument, heading off in the opposite direction to the Doctor. He felt almost compelled to stop, finding himself instinctively bowing his own head, as if he were attending...<br><br> A&nbsp; funeral.&nbsp; That was it.&nbsp; It was a funeral.&nbsp; Yes. The dappled grey of the long, hooded cloaks these people were wearing...&nbsp; That was a popular form of funeral attire in... Oh, somewhere in the universe the Doctor had long forgotten about.<br><br> And&nbsp; there&nbsp; was&nbsp; the&nbsp; grave.&nbsp; Right where they&nbsp; had all been standing.&nbsp; It had a rather beautiful but stark, engraved, orange headstone &#x2013; evidently imported from far away. Embedded in the curve of its upper edge were half a dozen small items, encased in glass or something very&nbsp;&nbsp; similar,&nbsp;&nbsp; like&nbsp;&nbsp; fragments of memory&nbsp;&nbsp; caught in clear amber.&nbsp; As with&nbsp;&nbsp; the dappled grey cloaks, the Doctor remembered, the encasing of a person&#x2019;s chosen mementoes in a gravestone was an age-old tradition in many parts of the cosmos.<br><br> As the Doctor began to approach the stone for a closer look, he suddenly felt he was being looked at. Twitching a look to the right, he saw one of the mourners.<br><br> It was an old lady. She had clearly paused to turn and look at him.<br><br> Their eyes met. To the Doctor, it felt like she was waiting for something. A greeting? Recognition? Something... But for the Doctor, there was nothing. He did not know her.<br> Perhaps she sensed this, it wasn&#x2019;t clear, but after a few seconds, she turned her head away and walked off, following the other mourners at a steady pace, making no attempt to catch up.<br><br> Shrugging, the Doctor turned his attention back to the embedded mementoes in glass. He found himself being drawn to what looked like a tiny spaceship. He pushed his face close to the transparent casing around its miniature hull.<br><br> &#x2018;Hmmm,&#x2019; he mused. &#x2018;Anyone at home?&#x2019;<br><br> Crouching, he could see some lettering on the underside of the ship.<br><br> &#x2018;Made in Carthedia,&#x2019;&nbsp; he read aloud.&nbsp; &#x2018;You&#x2019;re a toy, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x2019;&nbsp; The Doctor grinned his broad grin and ru&#xfb04;ed his hair. He chuckled to himself. He knew the difference between a memory and the faint tingle he felt when something from his future was reaching back to him. He knew that sometimes the complexities of time travel meant he had to be patient.<br><br> &#x2018;Something for another day,&#x2019; he muttered to himself.<br><br> &#x2018;But I shall remember you, little spaceship. I shall remember you.&#x2019; And he pointed at it, chuckling again, moving closer and closer to the glass. So close now that the little ship started to blur and the microscopic flaws in the transparent &#x2018;amber&#x2019; around it looked like the tracks of eternity, reaching out to tantalise the Doctor.<br><br> He snapped back up to his full height, swaying, inelegant, looking up at the giant monument. One day, this would mean something to him, he felt. One day...<br><br> But not today.<br><br> As the Doctor turned and left the graveside, striding off back to the TARDIS, he was being observed.<br><br> Deep within a vast, metallic complex, surging with the power of a terrifying, almost unimaginably superior technology there seethed the hatred and determination of a single, powerful intellect. Contained within the bonded polycarbide&nbsp; armour of a Dalek, this&nbsp; creature was the result of generations of genetic manipulation. Manipulation with but one aim: to furnish the Dalek race with a controlling force that could see into the frenzied chaos of the Time Vortex and read its unfathomable patterns.<br><br> This was the Dalek Time Controller.<br><br> The upper grating sections of its casing, just below its dome, were diagonally circled by revolving rings, like the whirling debris fields around a gas giant, appearing solid from a distance, but close up... Close up, they burned with the energy of the Vortex that unfolded in the open gateway in front of this ultimate form of Dalek life.<br><br> Its eyestalk twitched, agitatedly, as it followed the image superimposed in the centre of the Vortex. The Doctor was still moving towards his TARDIS on the planet Gethria.<br> Inside&nbsp; its&nbsp; casing, the&nbsp; mutant&nbsp; body&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Dalek Time Controller quivered&nbsp; with&nbsp; something very like anticipation&nbsp; and&nbsp; delight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind&nbsp;&nbsp; it,&nbsp; not&nbsp; daring to approach&nbsp; the&nbsp; open&nbsp; gateway&nbsp; into&nbsp; eternity, a&nbsp; squad of&nbsp; high-ranking Daleks&nbsp; eased a little&nbsp; closer to&nbsp; their soothsayer. They too had spotted the Doctor.<br><br> He was now entering the TARDIS. The door closed behind him. A few moments later, the TARDIS groaned the hoarse groan of its temporal engines and was gone.<br> In a voice infused with&nbsp; an almost exultant, dark determination, more&nbsp; guttural&nbsp; and&nbsp; yet&nbsp; more&nbsp; delicate than any other Dalek&#x2019;s voice, the Time Controller finally spoke.<br><br> &#x2018;It is beginning...&#x2019;<br><br> At another, precise point in the infinity of space and time, a young girl was terrified &#x2013; and it was becoming more and more di&#xfb03;cult for her to remember a time when she had not been. She sat, hunched, hugging herself as tight as she could, and shivering in spasms of cold and fear so relentless and all-consuming that it felt to her as if the cold and the fear were becoming the same thing.<br><br> She squeezed her eyes tight shut again. But all she found in her mind were terrible memories she could almost not bear to think about. She remembered the shouting, running, an explosion... Sheer terror.<br><br> There had been a man. He was kind, she had thought. He had rescued her... Her and her little brother.<br><br> Her little brother!<br><br> She remembered him calling out to her. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ll come back for you! We&#x2019;ll come back for you! I promise!&#x2019;<br><br> The thoughts were too painful and she opened her eyes again. The memories faded into the grimy, grey- silver walls of her boxed, featureless cell. She stared at the angles of the walls, followed the lines where they met the low ceiling, looked down to where they met the hard, metallic floor. Not for the first time, she felt the rising panic within her that this would be all she would see for the rest of her life. Seized by the fear of this unending blankness, she found herself cherishing the dim hope that a Dalek might come again to feed her. Just one Dalek with some food. Just something to break through the nothingness.<br><br> But&nbsp;&nbsp; there&nbsp;&nbsp; was nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just the&nbsp; low, mu&#xfb04;ed heartbeat of the Dalek ship&#x2019;s power&nbsp; and the vibration of its engines.<br><br> Time flowed&nbsp; past, but she had no way of knowing how fast or slow. Was this just a minute? Or days? Was she a...</p><h2>The Metal Shaper</h2><p>Exotic is a mild adjective when applied to the shaper. it will cut splines, keyways, gears, sprockets, dovetail slides, flat and angular surfaces and irregular profiles. and all of these with a simple hand-ground lathe tool bit. obsolete in modern industry, of course, because milling machines do the work much faster and cheaper. but you can&#39;t beat a shaper for simplicity and economy in the home shop.

Mailer breathes life into the figures of that era; the eighteenth dynasty Pharaoh Rameses and his wife, Queen Nefertiti; Menenhetet, their creature, lover and victim; and the gods and mortals that surround them in intimate and telepathic communion. His hero, three times reincarnated during the novel, moves in the bright sunlight of white temples, in the exquisite gardens of the royal harem, along the majestic flow of the Nile and in the terrifying clash of battle. An outstanding work of creative imagination, Ancient Evenings displays Mailer&#39;s obsession with magic, violence and eroticism and lives on in the mind long after the last page has been turned.</p><p>Born in Long Branch, NJ, in 1923, and raised in Brooklyn, Norman Mailer was one of the most influential writers of the second half of the 20th century and a leading public intellectual for nearly sixty years. He is the author of more than thirty books. The Castle in the Forest, his last novel, was his eleventh New York Times bestseller. His first novel, The Naked and the Dead, has never gone out of print. His 1968 nonfiction narrative, The Armies of the Night, won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. He won a second Pulitzer for The Executioner&#x2019;s Song and is the only person to have won Pulitzers in both fiction and nonfiction. Five of his books were nominated for National Book Awards, and he won a lifetime achievement award from the National Book Foundation in 2005. Mr. Mailer died in 2007 in New York City.One<br><br>The darkness was deep. Yet I had no doubt. I was in an underground chamber ten paces in length by half in width, and I even knew (just as quickly as a bat) that the room was all but empty. Stone was the surface of the walls and the floor. As if I could see with my fingers, I had only to wave an arm to feel the size of the space beyond my reach. It was exactly so remarkable as to hear voices by the hairs of one&#x2019;s nose. For that matter, I could smell the scent of stone. Say that an absence was in the air, some hollow that dwelt within another hollow. Now I was aware of a granite coffer near to me, as aware, indeed, of its presence as if my body had walked within&#x2014;it was huge enough to be my bed! But a step away, as if on guard, were some aged droppings on the floor, pellets from a small fierce animal who had managed like myself to find its way here, and left its deposit and gone. For there was no skeleton to speak of the beast. Just the scent of some old urine-�cursed� dung&#x2014; But where was the passage by which the animal could have entered? I breathed in the horror that comes when the air is close with an animal&#x2019;s mean excrement. That has its own message to give!<br><br>Yet, I could also recognize a pure bouquet of fresh night air that had chosen to enter this chamber. Had it come from a shaft in the rock used by the cat?<br><br>In the dark, between two blocks of stone, my fingers soon found a niche not much greater in width than a man&#x2019;s head. Still, by its fresh breath, it must lead outside. The air that arrived through the shaft was only a whisper, not strong enough to stir one hair on a feather, but it offered the cool of the desert when the sun has been down for much of the night. Toward that cool murmur, I stretched, and to my surprise was able to follow my arm up the niche. It was a long shaft between great blocks of stone, and in places seemed no wider than my head, but it went in a straight line at a steep angle upward, a filthy trip. The dead shells of countless beetles cluttered my way. Ants went by my skin. Rats piped in high terror. Still, I climbed with no panic, only in surprise at the narrow dimensions of this passage. Surely I was not able to make my way through&#x2014;it was hardly larger than the burrow of a snake&#x2014;yet I might as well have been without shoulders or hips. Cunning was in my touch as if, like a snake, there was no fear of being caught in the passage ahead. I was capable of becoming narrower. But that is no better than to say I traveled with my thoughts through the long narrow shaft, my body sufficiently supple to obey&#x2014;a most peculiar sensation. I felt altogether alive. The whisper of the air before me had phosphorescence. Particles of light glowed in my nose and throat. I was more alive than I could ever remember and yet felt no yoke of muscle and bone. It was as if I had been reduced to the size of a small boy.<br><br>When I lay at last near the mouth of the passage, my view was of the sky at the end of the shaft and moonlight slanted over the edge. As I rested, the moon passed full into view and anointed me. From orchards in the distance came a scent of date and fig trees, and the clear refreshment of the vines. The air on this night gave intimations to me of gardens where once I made love. I knew again the smell of rose and jasmine. Far below, by the riverbank, the palms by the shore would be black in outline against the silver water of the river.<br><br>So I came out at last from the end of the shaft in that great hill of stone. I stuck my head and shoulders into the open night, pulled through my legs, and gasped. Beneath the light of the moon was a long white slope of stone with the earth far below, but out there on the plateau of the desert, mute as a mountain of silver, there at the end of my gaze, was a Pyramid. Beyond it, another. Nearer to me, all but covered in sand, was a stone lion with the head of a man. I was perched on the slope of the Great Pyramid! I had just been&#x2014;it could be nowhere else&#x2014;in the burial chamber of the Pharaoh Khufu.<br><br>Harsh as the sound of a man&#x2019;s snore was the name of Khufu. He was gone a thousand years, and more. Yet, at the thought of having been in His tomb, my body was too weak to move. The sarcophagus of Khufu had been empty. His tomb had been found and robbed!<br><br>I thought my heart would strike its last sound. My stomach had never felt so pure a slop of cowardice. Yet I was a man of valor, as I seemed to remember, perhaps a soldier, renowned for something&#x2014;so, I could swear&#x2014;all the same, I could not move a step. In shame I shivered beneath the moon. There I was, on the slope of our greatest Pyramid, moonlight on my head and heart, the statue of the immense lion below, and the Pyramids of the Pharaoh Khaef-�ra� and the Pha�raoh Men-�kau-�ra to the south. To the east, I saw the moon on the Nile and far to the south, I even saw the last of the lights in the lamps of Memphi where mistresses were waiting for me. Or were they waiting for another by now? I was so reduced as to think it did not matter. Had I ever had a thought like this before?&#x2014;I, whose first fear used to be that I was too ready to kill any man who looked at my woman? How exhausted I felt. Was this the price I paid for entering the tomb of Khufu? In gloom, I began to make my way down, sliding from crack to crack in the limestone, and knew some foul change had taken place in me already. My memory, which had given every promise (in the first glow of moonlight) that it would return, was still a sludge. Now the air was heavy with the odor of mud. That was the aroma of these lands, mud and barley, sweat and husbandry. By noon tomorrow, the riverbank would be an oven of moldering reeds. Domestic animals would leave their gifts on the mud of the bank&#x2014;sheep and pigs, goats, asses, oxen, dogs and cats, even the foul odor of the goose, a filthy bird. I thought of tombs, and of friends in tombs. Like the plucking of a heavy string came a first intimation of sorrow.<br><br>Two<br><br>I was in the most peculiar situation. I still did not know who I was, nor how old I might be. Was I mature and powerful, or young and in the beginning of my strength? It hardly seemed to matter. I shrugged, and began to walk, taking, for whatever reason, a path through the Necropolis, and as I meandered, I began to explain to myself what I saw, or so I would put it, for I felt in the oddest position, and like a stranger to my own everyday knowledge.<br><br>Before me, I must say, was no more to see than the straight streets of this cemetery in the moonlight, a view without great charm, unless there is charm to be found in high value. Cubit for cubit, the city of the dead had the dearest plots in all of Memphi, or at least that is what I certainly remember.<br><br>Wandering down the alleys of our monotonous Necropolis, sauntering past the shuttered door of one tomb, then another, I began&#x2014;for no reason I could give&#x2014;to think of a friend who had died recently, the dearest of my friends, this memory seemed to say, and the most absurd and violent death. Now, I had no more than to wonder whether his tomb was anywhere near about, and was visited with more recollections. My friend, I was ready to think, came from a powerful family. His father, if I could recall, had once served as Overseer of the Cosmetic Box&#x2014;I would die, I thought, before lusting after such titles myself. Still, that was not a career to be sneered at altogether. Our Ramses, if I remembered correctly, was as vain as a beautiful girl, and detested any flaw in His appearance.<br><br>Of course, with such a father, my friend (whose name, I fear, still eluded me) was certainly wealthy and noble. Poor entombed bugger! He must be, at the least, a descendant of the great Ramses, yes, the one, I could recall, who died something like a hundred years ago, our own Ramses the Second. He had ended as a very old man with a great many wives and more than a hundred recorded sons and fifty daughters. They produced ancestors in such numbers that today you cannot begin to estimate how many officers and priests are Ramessides by at least half of their line. For truth, hardly a rich woman in Memphi or Thebes will fail to offer one bona-�fide� cheek of her buttocks, royal as the Pharaohs, and she will not fail to let you know. To be descended from Ramses the Second may not be exceptional, but it is �indispensable&#x2014;at least if she wants a family plot in the Necropolis. Then, she had better be, at least by half, a Ramesside. In fact, you cannot even buy a tomb in the Western Shade if you are not, and that is only the first requirement in such commerce among Memphi matrons. There are not enough plots. So they go to great lengths. For instance, the mother of my dead friend, the matron Hathfertiti, was always prepared to trade. If the price was good enough, the sarcophagus of an ancestor could be transferred to an inferior tomb, or even shipped downriver to another necropolis. Of course one had to ask: Who was the deceased? How substantial was his curse? That was the unspoken part of the transaction&#x2014;you had to be ready to take on a few malevolent oaths. But some were ready to welcome them if they were terrible enough to bring the price down. For example, Hathfertiti had been bold enough to sell the tomb of her dead grandfather. Concerning this dead relative, her husband&#x2019;s grandfather (who happened incidentally to be her own grandfather since she was certainly her husband&#x2019;s sister) it was told to the buyer that old man Menenhetet had been the kindest and most benign of men. His vice was that he could not harm his enemies. His curse need hardly be feared. What torture of the truth! In secret, it was whispered that Menenhetet had been known to eat fried scorpions with bat dung&#x2014;just so great was his need to protect himself against the curses of the powerful. He had had a mighty life, I seemed to remember.</p><h2>Casino Capitalism</h2><p>Clear and accessible style making easy reading. Challenges conventional ideas, particularly in economics.

Much of Europe once knew them as "child-devouring cannibals" and "bloodthirsty Huns." But it wasn't long before the Hungarians became steadfast defenders of the Christian West and fought heroic freedom struggles against the Tatars (1241), the Turks (16-18th centuries), and, among others, the Russians (1848-49 and 1956). Paul Lendvai tells the fascinating story of how the Hungarians, despite a string of catastrophes and their linguistic and cultural isolation, have survived as a nation-state for more than 1,000 years.</p><br><p> Lendvai, who fled Hungary in 1957, traces Hungarian politics, culture, economics, and emotions from the Magyars' dramatic entry into the Carpathian Basin in 896 to the brink of the post-Cold War era. Hungarians are ever pondering what being Hungarian means and where they came from. Yet, argues Lendvai, Hungarian national identity is not only about ancestry or language but also an emotional sense of belonging. Hungary's famous poet-patriot, S�ndor Petofi, was of Slovak descent, and Franz Liszt felt deeply Hungarian though he spoke only a few words of Hungarian. Through colorful anecdotes of heroes and traitors, victors and victims, geniuses and imposters, based in part on original archival research, Lendvai conveys the multifaceted interplay, on the grand stage of Hungarian history, of progressivism and economic modernization versus intolerance and narrow-minded nationalism.</p><br><p> He movingly describes the national trauma inflicted by the transfer of the historic Hungarian heartland of Transylvania to Romania under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon in 1920--a trauma that the passing of years has by no means lessened. The horrors of Nazi and Soviet Communist domination were no less appalling, as Lendvai's restrained account makes clear, but are now part of history.</p><br><p> An unforgettable blend of eminent readability, vibrant humor, and meticulous scholarship, <i>The Hungarians</i> is a book without taboos or prejudices that at the same time offers an authoritative key to understanding how and why this isolated corner of Europe produced such a galaxy of great scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs.</p></p><p><br><p>"This brief narrative of Hungarian history, elegantly translated into English, is written with verve, humor, profound insights, and just the right degree of cynicism. It well explains the dilemma of a respectable old state squeezed between more powerful neighbors, the contradictions between individual genius and repeated national failure, and the recurring tragic conflicts between the defense of nationhood and messianic nationalism.

Love Tactics will provide the answers for those who are very shy, a little on the quiet side, or sinmply not the social successes they want to be.</p><p>Thomas McKnight is a human relations expert and lecturer who writes and speakes on the subject of romantic love. Robert Phillips is a practicing psychologist and co-author of numerous self-help books.<p>Introduction</p> <p>The reason is very clear why <strong><i>Love Tactics</i></strong> has become a perennial bestseller over the last two decades. Why? The answer is painfully obvious to anyone who has ever felt the agonizing frustration of not having their love reciprocated.</p> <p>Isn&#x2019;t it ironic that in spite of the many technological advances made within the last century, people today are still as frustrated as ever in their quest for true love? Our society is full of individuals who have disappointedly abandoned their idealistic dreams of romantic fulfillment. It almost seems a law of nature that the one you want never wants you back, while the ones who are interested in you are simply incapable of stirring your emotions! Love forever looms on the horizon, but is just out of reach.</p> <p>Many have given up, deciding that nothing can be done to alter an apparently loveless destiny. They have resigned themselves to going through life, taunted by the prospects of love, but never truly possessing it. You may have experienced such feelings of helplessness yourself. If so, then this book is the answer to your prayers.</p> <p><strong><i>Love Tactics</i></strong> demonstrates why there is a very real reason not to give up hope. Love is not the mere result of chance meetings determined by pure luck. Believe it or not, love is a predictable human response! It results whenever a person&#x2019;s key psychological needs are satisfied. It&#x2019;s true that, on occasion, love does seem to occur accidentally. But even in these cases, such relationships still conform to the principles of romantic behavior outlined in this book. Anyone who chooses to consciously apply these rules of love in an intelligent manner need not go through life unloved. Succeeding in ro�mance, then, only requires becoming aware of your ability to modify and influence the emotional moods, attitudes, and behaviors of others through well-proven psychological techniques. We&#x2019;re not talking about taking unfair advantages&#x2015;just using strategic common sense!</p> <p>As you can probably imagine, it would be impossible to include all the different strategies, techniques, and tips that can possibly be used in winning the one you want. So <strong><i>Love Tactics</i></strong> provides the basic formula from which you will be able to derive your own solution to your particular circumstances. As you read the book, you&#x2019;ll find your�self becoming more enthusiastic, confident, and eager to approach others in your goal to win the person of your dreams.</p> <p>Divided into two main sections, <strong><i>Love Tactics</i></strong> presents dozens of techniques that are designed to help you in the most exciting search-and-succeed activities of your life. These strategies, which are found in Part One, will help you win the love of that special someone. Part Two goes a step further by helping those who feel they have already found their love, but have lost or are in danger of losing that person. How to win back another person&#x2019;s love is the theme of this section.</p> <p>Not all of the strategies found in <strong><i>Love Tactics</i></strong> are suitable for every situation. Different approaches work better than others, depending on the particular need of the moment. Experience will help you see which tactics are best suited for different conditions. None�theless, you&#x2019;ll also learn that certain fundamental principles of psychology always apply, and are the basis for your selection of tactics.</p> <p>You must nurture friendship, respect, and passion in order to win the heart of the one you want. This fundamental understanding is the bedrock foundation of the <strong><i>Love Tactics</i></strong> strategy, and the way to ultimately win. Trust that if you cultivate the relationship properly, you will ultimately reap a magnificent harvest!</p> <p>Of the many lessons you&#x2019;ll learn in <strong><i>Love Tactics</i></strong>, remember this important truth above all else: The way to true love is not to sit back and wait for the person of your dreams to magically appear. Rather, it involves choosing the one you want above all others, and then winning them over using known principles of human romantic behavior.</p> <p>Yes, you can win the one you want! You can also win back the one you&#x2019;ve lost! You don&#x2019;t have to settle for anything (or anyone) less. The dream is in sight! It&#x2019;s merely a matter of psychology. <strong><i>Love Tactics</i></strong> will acquaint you with the science of human behavior as it relates to love and romance, and teach you how to win the one you want!</p></p><h2>Thomas Moran&#39;s West: Chromolithography, High Art, and Popular Taste</h2><p>Watercolor images of Yellowstone Park painted in the early 1870s by artist Thomas Moran shifted America's gaze westward. Published as a portfolio of chromolithographs by Boston lithographer Louis Prang, these brilliant reproductions&#x2014;with a companion text on Yellowstone geology by explorer Ferdinand Hayden&#x2014;were the first color images of our first national park widely available to the general public. As such, they helped shape America's growing fascination with the West. <br><br>The Yellowstone National Park portfolio, comprising nine images of Yellowstone and six of other sites, is also now regarded as the finest example of chromolithography ever produced. Yet today these images are less well known than Moran's dramatic oil paintings and are usually admired merely as curiosities of an obsolete technology. <br><br>Joni Kinsey, a preeminent authority on Moran, shows that these and other chromolithographs by the artist in fact had an important place in American visual culture and were a vital part of the artist's career. <i>Thomas Moran's West</i> reproduces this renowned collection, along with two dozen other color plates and over 100 black-and-white illustrations, to recapture their impact on the American imagination. <br><br>Chromolithography was outmoded by 1900 but represented an important transition in American art. Whereas previously published images of the West had been black-and-white engravings, Moran's chromolithographs had the vivid beauty of high art but could be acquired by individuals who couldn't afford originals. Today the prints are highly valued by collectors, who will appreciate seeing them with related field sketches and watercolors&#x2014;and in some instances rare printer's proofs from Joslyn Art Museum. Kinsey describes the making and popularity of "chromos," chronicles the debates over their artistic legitimacy, and tells how this medium competed with other forms of picture-making in the late nineteenth century. She also explores Moran's relationship with Prang and thoroughly analyzes the Yellowstone images&#x2014;including those held back from publication. <br><br>Both a visual feast and an authoritative treatise, <i>Thomas Moran's West</i> gives us breath-taking images of unspoiled wilderness as it sheds new light on how artistic portrayals of the West contributed to our national identity.</p><p>"As Kinsey points out, 'chromolithographs offer important lessons in the role of visual technology in an increasingly modern society,' and Moran's treatment of Yellowstone (and other regions in the West) provides insight into how the American West was viewed, and on what terms, in the post-Civil War era. . . . Given the popularity of Western art, the very high esteem in which Moran is held among art historians and collectors, and Kinsey's excellent reputation as a scholar, this book should do very well. . . . A valuable contribution."--Erika Doss, author of <i>Twentieth-Century American Art</i>Joni L.

James Bond. The ultimate British hero--suave, stoic, gadget-driven--he was more than anything the necessary invention of a traumatized country whose self-image as a great power had just been shattered by the Second World War. Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, was an upper-class wastrel who had found purpose and excitement in the war, and to whom, like so many others, its end was a terrible disappointment--the elation of survival stifled by the reality of the new British impotence. In 1952 Fleming set out to repair this damage. By inventing the magical, parallel world of <i>secret </i>British greatness and glamour, he fabricated an icon that has endured long past its maker's death. <br> <br>To grow up in England in the 1970s was to grow up with James Bond, and <i>The Man Who Saved Britain </i>is first of all the story of the author's relationship with the "national religion." Simon Winder lovingly and ruefully re-creates the nadirs and humiliations of fandom while illuminating what Bond's evolution--from books to film, from his roots in the 1940s to his "managed decline" today--says about the conservative movement, sex, the monarchy, food, attitudes toward America, class, and everything in between. <i>The Man Who Saved Britain </i>is an insightful and, above all, entertaining exploration of postwar Britain through the palliative influence of one of its most legendary icons, the larger-than-life Agent 007.<br></p><p>Simon Winder is the editor of several anthologies, including the highly praised <i>Night</i> <i>Thoughts</i>. He works in publishing in London, where he lives with his family.<br>Introduction&nbsp;<br>Eating Old Jamaica at the Tunbridge Wells Odeon<br>&nbsp;<br>I am ten years old, sitting in a suburban English cinema. On the screen a man with a large chin and black roll-neck sweater pushes through jungle foliage. He crouches behind a gravestone and takes out an enormous pistol. A white woman has been tied to a post and a black man dressed in animal skins is laughing crazily and wielding a massive poisonous snake. Around them hundreds of voodoo worshippers are screaming and convulsing. The man with the large chin starts shooting the black people, who are too busy rolling their eyes and waving old cutlasses to offer proper resistance.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest my memory goes a bit hazy at this point. In a moment of bravado before the film I had bought a jumbo Old Jamaica, a weird 1970s chocolate bar filled with rum essence and raisins. It had struck me as a sophisticated treat, little realizing that its only target market was in fact aspirational ten-year-old boys. Anyway, the reality of feeling sick, the perception of being drunk, and the confusion of the notionally West Indian flavour of the treat and the loosely West Indian setting of the film conspired to overwhelm me. Leaving the voodoo worshippers to their fate I staggered to the toilets. Thirty years later, rum essence still flings me back--like some reduced-to-clear Proust--to that cinema and what proved to be a transformative encounter with a man with a large chin.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing this is peculiarly painful. The film in question was Live and Let Die, and its hero, James Bond, has since that moment deeply affected my life. For me that film pushed open the Golden Doors of sex and death, revealing a world of sophistication and cruelty previously unimagined. Sheltered by a prior movie diet of such duff material as Tales of Beatrix Potter, a ballet film featuring a dancing frog, I suddenly had discovered a film packed with steel-clawed black giants, alligators, speedboats and girls whimpering, "Oh, James." The Two Bad Mice prancing about hitting a little plaster fish (which of course, at the time, I had absolutely loved) became overnight something thought of always but spoken of never.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to see Live and Let Die again a week later, this time spurning the siren song of the Old Jamaica: it was a flawless gem. Every scene conveyed so much--the brutal cunning of the villains, the decency and wit of Bond, the glamorous American and West Indian locations, the miraculous music. Happy years followed of reading and reading again all the Bond books, tracking down the older Bond films, preparing myself spiritually for the next one, The Man with the Golden Gun.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The painfulness in all this is of course that Live and Let Die is dreadful. In a moment of lunatic parental outreach I recently bought the DVD to watch with my own twelve- and ten-year-old sons. I had not seen the movie in many years and this planned piece of quality nurturing left me mute with grief. The film was a mean-spirited and offensive shambles, too stupid really even to be racist, too chaotic to be camp. Worse, the film was the first to feature Roger Moore--a faintly louche manikin, famous as the Saint and, with Tony Curtis (then going through one of his cyclical career low-points), one of the Persuaders. Moore was to spearhead the progressive degeneration of Bond over a further seven films. Now I can see that I encountered and fell for Bond at the precise point, 1973, when he was spiralling out of control.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet for many years he had been important--important to millions of people in all kinds of ways, a uniquely powerful, strange presence in British life since his invention by Ian Fleming in the early 1950s. Wholly oblivious, I had as a ten-year-old bumped into his most embarrassing avatar, but my entire upbringing had been in effect soaked in the world in which Bond had thrived and in which he was understood. In this time--before Bond films were ever shown on television--double bills of old ones would tour cinemas, playing to vast steaming audiences, seeing the films, like myself, over and over again almost as a religious undertaking. I was simply then the latest among whole populations of men and women (well, mainly men to be honest) who had stood in line for the Bond experience. Our school games were soaked in Bond, our talk was endlessly about the films and about the cruelty and sex in the books: Bond was a sort of currency, albeit, and quite unknown to me, one in steep decline on the open market.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book is an attempt to get to grips with Bond's legacy and with the worlds in which Bond really mattered--not to a helpless ten-year-old ding-a-ling in the early seventies but to the generation who had fought in the Second World War and who in vast numbers read the Bond books in the 1950s and saw the Bond films in the 1960s.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope to explore with reasonable seriousness the trauma faced by Britain in the 1940s and after--a far smaller trauma than that of mainland Europe, but profound nonetheless and one that could have been terminal. The link between Bond's invention and his overwhelming success and the horrors faced by Britain from 1939 onwards are close and interesting. Ian Fleming, a cynical upper-class waster galvanized by and briefly endorsed by the emergency of the War, reacted to the gradual, but sometimes vertiginous, implosion of Britain when the fighting had ended by creating the Bond books. These proceeded to find their vast niche as part of a general right-wing reaction to the humiliations and failures of British life. I want to re-create some of the stifling British obsession with the Second World War, which still cannot be shaken even today, but which once permeated all aspects of life and was dominant throughout my own childhood. Toys, film, novels, memoirs about the War were everywhere, and through them strode James Bond, the secret hero who calmly carried the values of that war through a treacherous and ungrateful Cold War world.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inevitably this book must lean heavily on a sort of ancient archaeology--here are the remains of a door post, here a possible site of cult ritual. So much has changed and so rapidly that it is hard to get right inside the original impact of the books or the films. Morals have changed, movie gun noises are much more reverberant, sex has got sexier. The Cold War has, weirdly, completely vanished, leaving behind such peculiar debris as From Russia with Love, a book and a film which will appear as strange to future generations as abandoned Kazakhstan rocket silos or fallout shelters.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As a memoir, this book is fragmentary and scraped together from very slightly interesting bits and bobs. My life has just not been melodramatic enough to take up more than a few pages. I had a cheerful childhood packed with affection, no specific features to incite sympathy and no adventures to speak of. As history it will anger many, filled as it is with shocking generalizations and lack of documentation. I share that anger. This book was written in large part because I want to convey, perhaps in an overdrawn form, some of the ways in which Britain has changed--and by following James Bond show some of a vanished world which he in various ways pulled together.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The eight chapters are roughly chronological, pursuing Fleming's, Britain's and Bond's lives from the 1930s to the 1970s with occasional comfort-breaks to deal with specific themes. I have tried to give just enough background on Britain and its empire to make events around and after the War intelligible. While carefully researched, this material is breathtakingly selective and loaded with no doubt facetious and callow interpretation of a kind that will have historians shrieking to heaven for vengeance. I should really emphasize that I am not a professional historian and that anyone who has devoted their life to a serious study of this period should probably see about swapping this for something else.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A further obvious point is that this is a book only about some people some of the time: for every individual concerned about Britain's international prestige or the global nuclear threat there were countless more simply getting on with their lives. It is a simile used before, but it is like Brueghel's painting Landscape with the Fall of Icarus: a shepherd stares at the clouds, a ploughman ploughs a field, a merchant ship hurries by, and down in the corner Icarus crashes--with a tiny ploof! of water--completely unremarked into the sea. Clearly the end of the British Empire was for very many people an unremarked and tiny ploof! but for many others, continuously or intermittently, it was much more.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Devoted contemporary fans will be driven to distraction by this book. Going to a premiere of the last Bond film, Die Another Day, at the Empire Leicester Square, I had to say that I was unmoved by what happened on the screen. Tiny voices whispered that Die Hard did this better, that Face/Off did this better, that even Vin Diesel's xXx did this better. I'm afraid that some years back I parted from the Way and feel relieved at having done so. But Bond's later abasement should not cloud what he used to be and movies featuring John Cleese as Q and an invisible car cannot sully the immense pleasures of the books and the early films.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This then is part memoir, part history, part a meditation on being a fan/not being a fan. The little telltale phrase, though, in the last paragraph, "going to a premiere," will of course tell you all you need to know. I am not exactly cured. Like a hopeless modern version of Goya's The Sleep of Reason Brings Forth Monsters, I lie slumped at my desk with disturbingly well-thumbed copies of Diamonds Are Forever and DVDs of Octopussy (for God's sake) flapping about my head. But that I think still applies to British men in general--if diminishingly so--who still walk a little differently, dream certain dreams, and are somewhat comforted and sexually a little odder than would have been the case without the imagination of a man born into a very different sort of Britain.<br>&nbsp;<br>Excerpted from The Man Who Saved Britain: A Personal Journey into the Disturbing World of James Bond by Simon Winder.

Revered mystery writer Josephine Tey is traveling from Scotland to London for the final week of her play <em>Richard of Bordeaux</em>, the surprise hit of the season, with pacifist themes that resonate in a world still haunted by war. But joy turns to horror when her arrival coincides with the murder of a young woman she had befriended on the train ride&#x2014;and Tey is plunged into a mystery as puzzling as any in her own works. </p><p>Detective Inspector Archie Penrose is convinced that the killing is connected to the play, and that Tey herself is in danger of becoming a victim of her own success. In the aftermath of a second murder, the writer and the policeman must join together to stop a ruthless killer who will apparently stop at nothing.</p></p><p><p>Nicola Upson is the author of five previous Josephine Tey mysteries, including <em>An Expert in Murder</em>, and two works of nonfiction. She has worked in theater and as a freelance journalist. A recipient of an Escalator Award from the Arts Council England, she splits her time between Cambridge&nbsp; and&nbsp; Cornwall.&nbsp;</p>Mystery writer Josephine Tey (<i>The Daughter of Time</i>) makes a convincing sleuth in British author Upson's debut, the launch of a new whodunit series. On a train journey from Scotland to London in 1934, Tey meets a fan, Elspeth Simmons, who's traveling to the capital to attend a performance of Tey's hit play about Richard II. When Simmons is found brutally murdered&#x2014;stabbed with a hatpin, posed with some dolls and partially shaved&#x2014;after arrival at King's Cross, Tey's Scotland Yard friend, Insp. Archie Penrose, investigates and soon learns that the victim was adopted under irregular circumstances. After another death, the evidence suggests that both crimes are linked to a murder committed amid the devastating trench warfare of WWI. While the heroine falls conventionally into the killer's clutches before a solution many will anticipate, the engaging prose will leave even readers unfamiliar with Tey's fiction eagerly looking forward to the next in the series. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Each chapter also addresses important events and transformations in the state&#39;s history such as: European settlement; Native American resistance; the creation of territorial and state governments; the development of the state&#39;s educational and economic institutions; the disruption created by the Civil War; the struggle of African Americans and women to participate in Ohio&#39;s public life; efforts to ameliorate the pernicious effects of industrialization; the negotiation of the state&#39;s role in a nation increasingly dominated by the federal government; or the ramifications of de-industrialization and rise of a service economy.</p><p>Warren Van Tine is professor of history at The Ohio State University. <b>Michael Pierce</b> is associate director of the Arkansas Center for Oral and Visual History, assistant editor of the <i>Arkansas Historical Quarterly,</i> and instructor of history at the University of Arkansas.<br><br>Michael Pierce is a former editor of Kites, the magazine of the Highgate Poets.

Fitzmyer's The Acts of the Apostles is indispensable. Beginning with the Ascension of Christ into heaven, and ending with Paul proclaiming the kingdom of God from a prison in Rome, this New Testament narrative picks up where the Gospel of Luke left off. The Acts of the Apostles is indeed a journey of nearly epic proportions--and one that requires a guide as adept as Fitzmyer.<br>Since Acts was most likely written by the same person who composed the Gospel of Luke, it is only fitting that the Anchor Bible Commentaries on these New Testament books should be written by the same author. With The Acts of the Apostles, Fitzmyer gives readers the long-awaited companion to his two-volume commentary on the Gospel of Luke.</p><p>The Four Gospels recount the life and teachings of Jesus, but only the book of the Acts of the Apostles tells the story of what happened after Jesus&#x2019; departure. In this second of St. Luke&#x2019;s two-volume work, he picks up with Jesus saying farewell to his followers; then Luke tells the fast-paced story of the birth and growth of the early church. This narrative reads like a major breaking news story, with the apostles Peter and Paul as the main characters.</p><p>The interpretation of Acts requires a scholar of the highest quality. As he demonstrates in <i>The Acts of the Apostles</i>, Joseph Fitzmyer not only is up to the task but establishes once again why he is ranked among the world&#x2019;s top biblical scholars. Far from being a rehash of old ideas and well-rehearsed theories, Fitzmyer&#x2019;s commentary distinguishes itself as the capstone of his career, with a new synthesis of all the relevant data from the Roman world to the present. He provides a thorough introduction to the background, text, and context of the book, as well as chapter-by-chapter notes and comments in which are offered insights and answers to questions that have long plagued preachers and parishioners, teachers and students. This commentary is destined to join Fitzmyer&#x2019;s Anchor Bible commentaries on the Gospel According to Luke and the Epistle to the Romans as the most authoritative commentary available on Acts.</p></p><p><p>Joseph A.

The Wizard has been searching for the stone for more than 100 years, but the forces of evil are closing in, determined to possess and destroy its special power.

In the classic style of young people's fantasy, the young protagonists of this book, a sister and brother, must be brave and act under extraordinary circumstances to save the world as we know it. Madoc catches the kids' feelings of anxiety and disbelief at what is being asked of them. His sense of engagement is contagious, and the air of suspense is well deserved. No flashy tricks, sleight of hand, or easy answers will be found in this enchanting tale of good and evil.

Vidor, planning to make a movie about William Desmond Taylor, murdered in 1922, set out to investigate the unsolved crime 45 years later. Taylor had been a famous director of silents and his death was a sensation that ruined the careers of actresses Mary Miles Minter, Mabel Normand (the victim's reputed lovers) and other Hollywood luminaries. Kirkpatrick skillfully leads the reader into Vidor's search as the director studies old files and questions people in the movie colony who remembered those involved in the tragedy. The result is a riveting mystery. In his dramatic reconstruction, Kirkpatrick uncovers Vidor's convincing evidence, never disclosed by the director, that Taylor was killed by the mother of ingenue Minter.

(June<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.In 1922, Hollywood film director William Desmond Taylor was murdered, and the crime was never officially solved. In 1967, the late director King Vidor decided to investigate the mystery in order to make a film about it. (No film resulted.) Kirkpatrick recounts the story of Vidor's sleuthing, which uncovered scandal, corruption, coverups, and, ultimately, Vidor believed, the identity of the killer. This is a well-researched book, breezily related, whose impact is lessened somewhat by digressions into Vidor's personal life. The combination of Hollywood and murder is likely to be popular.

Lightning splintered the midnight sky, and thunder bellowed. Rain poured down from the heavens, and the sea crashed against the huge granite rocks of the coast, splattering white sea-foam up the sharp cliff on which Duart Castle stood. </p><p> For five hundred of its six hundred years, the castle had been the stronghold of the clan MacLean and host to their cousins, the clan MacQuarrie. But the Battle of Culloden Moor had changed all that. On that dark, dank moor some sixty-seven years earlier, Scot stubbornness had caused many a clan to lose its holdings. The MacLeans had lost their stronghold to the Sassenach -- Englishmen who cared not a wit for the braw, bold power of the place. The castle stood empty now, dark and abandoned. </p><p> Or so it appeared. </p><p> The skies bellowed and crackled, and the seas roared. To mere mortals it was only another storm, but to those who knew, to those of the ancient faith, it was more than just the heavens and the earth battling. </p><p> The witches were awake. </p><p> Now, there were witches, and there were <i>witches.</i> And then there were the MacQuarries. </p><p> 'Tis a sad tale, that of the MacQuarries, a tale that had begun hundreds of years before this night. An ancient forefather of the current MacQuarrie had been summoned to the fete of the spring equinox in what is now the south of England. There, on a wide plain, stood a massive stone temple where the witches and warlocks met to demonstrate their powers. On that special spring it had been decreed that the MacQuarrie warlock would have the cherished honor of making those most precious springtime flowers -- the roses -- bloom. Other witches and warlocks had already walked into the center of the temple and used their magic to bring life back to a winterdead earth. </p><p> 'Twas a sight to see that day when, in a matter of moments, green grass broke through the sodden ground. Wallflower bushes, buttercups, and dandelions spread a frosting of bright yellow across the fresh green that had magically sprouted. Soon the barren branches of birch trees were dripping with silvery spring leaves and tall elegant alders burst anew. Oak, ash, and elm came back to life with little more than the casting of a spell, the flick of a hand, or the flashing snap of a witch's magic. The scent of jasmine, primrose, marigold, and lavender filled the cool morning air, and suddenly it was spring. Birds and insects swarmed through the air and perched in the trees, and the melody of the lark, the hum of the bees and call of doves brought music to the land that had for too many cold, dreary months been silent. </p><p> Then it was the MacQuarrie's turn. The crowd parted as he made his way to the center of the stone temple. The room was silent, so silent one could have heard a blink, as each and every witch and warlock waited for that special moment. The MacQuarrie stood there for a long moment of quiet concentration. Then slowly he raised his hands toward the massive ceiling and with a snap of his fingers, let loose his magic. </p><p> No roses bloomed that day. </p><p> Instead an enormous explosion, the like of which no one had ever seen, blew the temple walls and roof into the sky. When the dust settled and the air cleared and the witches and warlocks picked themselves up off the ground, the temple was no more. Nothing stood except a few circles of stone arches. </p><p> Modern mortals look in awe at the ruins they call Stonehenge, but mention the name Stonehenge to the witches of the world and to this very day they shake their heads in dismay and mutter about the shame of the MacQuarries. </p><p> And it came to pass that in the year of our Lord 1813 there were only two witches left in all of Scotland -- a MacLean and, of all things, a MacQuarrie. So on this brash night as the storm battered the shore of the isle of Mull, as it rained on the crumbling ruins of a once-proud castle perched upon that jagged stone headland, as the mortals on that tiny island cowered by their fires and listened to the heavens wait, the MacLean and the MacQuarrie made magic. </p><p> Joyous Fiona MacQuarrie bent down to pick up the scattering of books on the tower room floor. Ten golden bracelets jangled like sleigh bells down her wrists and echoed in the tense silence of the room. She was thankful for the noise; it gave her a blessed moment's respite from the impatient, penetrating glare of her aunt, the MacLean. With her face turned away from her aunt, Joy grabbed another book, tucking it under her arm as she muttered, "'Twas only one wee tad of a word." She picked up another book, to the accompaniment of those same tinkling bracelets, but as they settled on her wrists she could hear a new sound -- a distinct, agitated tapping. </p><p> Her aunt's foot. </p><p> Joy peeked under her outstretched arm and winced. Her aunt's arms were crossed, and she shook her golden head in disgust. But worst of all, Joy could see the MacLean's lips move: her aunt was counting again. </p><p> Joy's heart sank; she'd failed again. With a defeated sigh she quietly returned the books to their ancient oak shelf and plopped onto a wobbly wooden stool after pulling it closer to the trestle table that stood in the center of the tower room. She rested a small chin in her hand and waited for her aunt to reach a hundred -- at least she hoped it would be only a hundred. </p><p> A slick cat with fur as white as fresh Highland snow leapt onto the table and wound itself around and through the three time-tarnished brass candlesticks whose tapers bathed the battered oak table in flickering golden light. As the cat meandered along the table its tail cast strange shadows across the nicked tabletop. Entranced by the patterns, Joy tried to make imaginary letters out of those cat's-tail figures, her mind wandering off on one of its frequent journeys of fancy. That was her problem. She was a witch with a wandering mind. </p><p> The cat, Gabriel, was her aunt's familiar -- an embodied spirit in animal form whose duty was to serve, attend, and in some cases, guard a witch. She glanced at her own familiar, Beelzebub, an ermine weasel whose coat was currently winter white except for wee spots of black on his tail and paws. The snowy fur covered a massive potbelly that made him look more like a plump rabbit than a sleek, almost feline weasel. He was at that moment, as at most moments, sound asleep. </p><p> She sighed. Beezle was the only animal who was willing to be her familiar. </p><p> Cats like Gabriel were proud, arrogant animals; they absolutely refused to be associated with a witch who couldn't control her magic. Owls were too wise to ally themselves with someone as inept as Joy. And toads, well, they took one look at her, croaked, and hopped away. </p><p> Plump old Beezle wheezed in his sleep. Joy watched his black-tipped paws twitch and reminded herself that at least she had a familiar, even if he was only a weasel. As if sensing her thoughts, he cracked open one lazy brown eye and peered at her as if calmly waiting for the next disaster. She reached out to scratch his plush belly and promptly knocked over a pot of cold rose hip tea. </p><p> Gabriel hissed and sprang out of the path of the spilled tea. Beezle didn't move that fast. Beezle seldom moved at all. The tea pooled like the tide around him. He blinked twice, looked at the tea seeping onto his white fur, and gave her a look not unlike the MacLean's before he shook himself, sending a sprinkling of tea in every direction. He waddled over to a dry spot and plopped back down with a soft thud, then rolled over, paws in the air, plump white and pink belly up, and stared at the ceiling. Joy wondered if animals could count. Beezle opened his mouth and let out a loud wheeze, then a snore. </p><p> Count in their sleep, she amended, drumming her fingers on the table. </p><p> "Whatever am I to do with you?" the MacLean finally spoke, having taken enough time to count to a hundred twice. Her aunt's stance was stern, but her voice held the patience that arose from what was almost a mother's love. </p><p> That love made the situation even worse for Joy. She truly wanted to hone her magic skills for her patient aunt as well as for her own pride's sake, and she was miserable because she couldn't get it right. She absently drew one finger through the dust on the table, then looked at her aunt and mentor. "Can one word truly make such a difference?" </p><p> "Every single word is of the utmost importance. An incantation must be exact. Part of the power comes from the voice." The MacLean took a deep breath and clasped her hands behind her. "The rest takes practice. Concentration!" She paced around the circular room, her strong voice echoing off the stone walls like bagpipes in the Highlands. With the suddenness of a wink, she stopped and looked down at Joy. "Now pay attention. Watch me." </p><p> Standing to Joy's left, she raised her elegant hands high in the air, allowing the fine gold threads in her embroidered silk robe to catch the candlelight and glimmer like the twinkling of fairy dust. Joy caught her breath. Standing as she was, tall and golden with the midnight sky as a backdrop through the tower window, her aunt looked like a goddess. Her long straight hair, which hung in a gleaming satin drape past her hips to the backs of her knees, was the color of hammered gold. Her skin was as flawless as pure cream and appeared ageless in the muted glow of the candlelight. The MacLean's robe was white -- not the stark white of cotton or the ivory white of lamb's wool but the same shimmering white that the stars shone, that lightning sparked, that diamonds glittered and the sun glowed. </p><p> A breath of cold Scottish wind whistled through the tower room, making the candle flames flicker. The sharp smell of hot tallow mingled with the scent of midnight rain and the brine of the roiling seas that rode the whisper of wind through the room. Shadows danced a jagged jig up the granite walls, and the sound of waves crashing against the sharp coastal rocks b...</p></p><h2>Joan of Arc: The Image of Female Heroism</h2><p>Examines the life of Joan of Arc and explores the meaning of Joan both to her contemporaries and succeeding generations--Joan as hero, prophet, heretic, androgyne, harlot, and saint</p><p><b>Marina Warner</b> is a historian and novelist; among her books are <i>No Go the Bogeyman: Scaring, Lulling, and Making Mock </i>(1998), <i>From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales and Their Tellers </i>(1995), and <i>Alone of All Her Sex: The Myth and the Cult of the Virgin Mary </i>(1983).

However, with the Cold War and NATO it evolved into something quite different: a major military force permanently stationed on the continent. This work is a study of that unique force, a permanent British Army presence on the continent of Europe. Each section begins with an overview, especially of divisions and brigades, and then continues with one or more detailed orders of battle for the period. These orbats are divided to coincide with major changes in the structure of the forces in Germany. The level of detail of support units tends to increase as we reach more recent times, although all orbats contain details on infantry, armour, artillery, engineers and signals. In the case of artillery, the batteries assigned to a regiment as well as the weapons types are indicated; engineer units are carried down to squadron level. For all units, location is given (or shown as &#34;location unknown&#34;). A replacement unit is always at the same location as its predecessor unless a new location is given for the replacement unit. In the case of artillery, unless indicated otherwise a replacement regiment has the same armament as the unit it replaces and thus weapons types are not repeated.</p><p></p><h2>The Elevator (Steeple Hill Women&#39;s Fiction #46)</h2><p>In the path of a devastating hurricane, three<br>very different women find themselves trapped<br>in the elevator of a high-rise office building.<br>All three conceal shattering secrets&#x2014;unaware<br>that their secrets center on the same man.<br>The betrayed wife, eager to confront her<br>faithless husband, with rage in her heart and<br>a gun in her pocket...<br>The determined mistress, finally ready to tell<br>her lover she wants marriage and a family...<br>The fugitive cleaning woman, tormented by<br>the darkest secret of all...<br>As the storm rages ever closer, these three<br>must unite to fight for their lives in the<br>greatest test of courage&#x2014;and faith&#x2014;any<br>woman could ever face.</p><p><p>In the path of a devastating hurricane, three very different women find themselves trapped in an elevator of a high-rise office building.

Prints are analysed as commercial and art objects, rathers than as simple historical records of matters maritime. The aim is to address a broad audience , including general readers of eighteenth and nineteenth century British and colonial history, those interested in ports and maritime affairs, and those with an interest in prints themselves.<br><br>The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a period of enormous political and commercial development across the globe. Of particular importance was the revolution in transportation and communication by sea, with the concomitant growth in size and importance of the seaport.<br><br>Despite growing awareness that the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a formative period in the development of maritime art, there has been relatively little exploration of maritime prints. This is extraordinary, since the period c.1700-1870 was a golden age of print production and saw the development of new forms of engraving such as aquatint and lithography, as well as the production of beautiful examples of line engraving and woodcut.<br><br>The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw the establishment and expansion of major ports not just in Britain, but in continental Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and in North and South America. The National Maritime Museum, upon which collection this book is based, is at the centre of the preservation and display of Britain's maritime heritage. Its print collection reveals the firm link between art and commerce in the development of these ports.<br></p><p><b>Dr. Cindy Mcreery</b> is currently Vice-Chancellor's Postdoctural Research Fellow in the School of History at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.

So when Lord Artos&#x2014;later known as King Arthur&#x2014;needs an interpreter to help him buy large horses to breed a troop strong enough to carry armed warriors against the Saxon invaders, Galwyn gets a chance to redeem his father&#x2019;s honor and make a name for himself. <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Includes an author&#x2019;s note..</strong></i><strong><br></strong></p><p>Anne McCaffrey is back with this precious, well-researched yarn that follows a Celtic lad in service to King Arthur. Set in fifth-century Britain, McCaffrey's first historical novel for young adults rejects a fantastical, Hollywood treatment of King Arthur in favor of realism and solid storytelling. Take away the Round Table and the usual knights-in-shining-armor hoo-hah, and you're left with an engaging, endearing chapter from the life of Artos, <i>Comes Britannorum</i>, a young war leader in search of horses strong enough to carry his armored warriors into battle against the savage Saxons.<p> The story is told through the eyes of polite, earnest young do-gooder Galwyn Varianus, who has fled the service of his cruel, brutish, seafaring uncle to take up with the charismatic Artos. Galwyn quickly proves his value with his affinity for languages and horses, and he accompanies Artos and the <i>Companions</i> (proto-Knights of the Round Table) as they execute their plan: acquiring and then breeding a handful of fabled <i>Libyans</i>, the horses of the book's title, and then mastering and disseminating the knowledge of horseshoe-making. The action revolves around Galwyn's role in this plan and never rises above the pace of, say, an after-school special. But rich details, McCaffrey's obvious love of the subject matter, and involving characters go a long way to make up for the story's slow trot. (In particular, you'll find yourself waiting eagerly for the comeuppance of one character, a sneering rider named Iswy, Goofus to Galwyn's Gallant.) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Anne McCaffrey is best known for the dragons she invented in her Dragonriders of Pern series. What many people don't know is that her first love was for horses--and it still is! A number of years ago, she realized her dream of building a horse farm, and each year I go to visit her in Ireland, I see improvements and get the guided tour of all the horses. This last visit, Anne showed me where some of her most beloved horses are buried--and I was moved at how choked up she got just pointing out the spot (and a gorgeous spot it is, too, with views across the fields down to the Irish Sea). So it was no surprise to me when Anne wrote Black Horses for the King, a tale of King Arthur from the point of view of the boy who helped him build his cavalry and brought the art of farriery (shoeing horses, for those who aren't familiar with the term) to the British Isles. Anne even ran her own farriery school in Ireland for a while. So I know that the details in this book are correct, and the subject is about as near and dear to the author's heart as one could get.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive Editor<br></p><h2>The Flash (featuring Impulse): Mercury Falling</h2><p>Before he graduated into the big leagues and became the super-fast, crimson hero the Flash, Bart Allen was the brash, teenaged speedster known as Impulse!<br><br>When Max Mercury, the "zen guru of the Speed Force" discovers that his connection to the very energy source that gives him super-speed has been severed, it's up to Bart to find a way to save his mentor and surrogate father.

When the celebrations are over, the happy couple set out together to look for their first home - a journey which turns out to be the start of further adventures.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 2 After an elaborate wedding, newlywed mice George and Matilda (called Emily in previous volumes), set off to find their own home in town. In a city garden they literally stumble across an abandoned doll house which comes complete with a working fireplace and the type of fancy doll-sized furnishings most mice newlyweds would only dream of, and they start to raise a family of their own. As in earlier books about these characters ( Emily Mouse's Beach House, Emily Mouse's Garden, George Mouse's Covered Wagon, George Mouse's Riverboat Band all Dial, 1987), the fantasy world depicted in the detailed full-color illustrations is saccharine and squeaky clean. Sweetly dressed, dewy-eyed mice look purposefully posed in illustration after illustration. Unfortunately, the stringing together of endearing details does not a story make. George's sighting of a cat in the distance while he's on one of his bland ventures through the garden provides the only hint of conflict. There is little in either text or illustration to distinguish one mouse character from another. Readers who might enjoy the imaginative visual details of a miniature fantasy world will be disappointed with the inconsistencies here. For example, Buchanan has gone to great pains to show a mouse-sized wagon built out of spools, sticks, and a matchbox, while mouse-sized accessories such as top hats and toothbrushes appear gratuitously throughout the story. If the personal saga of George and Matilda is to continue to subsequent volumes, we can only hope for a more active role on the part of the cat. Kathleen T.

She watches me while she stands with all her weight positioned on one skinny leg, one nonexistent hip thrust out with her hand resting on it, the bent angle and sharp point of her elbow making an almost perfect triangle of bony flesh against the yellow custom paint job of my Subaru Outback.<br><br> Her other hand holds the hand of her brother, not tightly but not casually either, the way a daisy holds on to its petals.<br><br> "Maybe he doesn't want to be sold," I tell her. "Maybe he wants to stay here."<br><br> "Then you could keep him. He can't do much now but when he gets older he could be like a slave for you."<br><br> I look down at the little guy. The spray of freckles across his nose and the hand-me-down jeans with rips in the knees and the cuffs rolled up several times remind me of my own son, Clay, when he was that age.<br><br> He turns twenty-four today. I have to remember to give him a call later. I don't make a big deal over his birthday now that he's grown. I don't let myself get emotional either, since the emotions surrounding his birth have always left me feeling torn up inside. I guess that's what happens when the best thing in your life is the result of the worst mistake of your life.<br><br> I wasn't all that much older than this girl standing in front of me now when my dad dropped me off at the entrance of the Centresburg Hospital, already two hours into my contractions, and told me to call him when I was "done."<br><br> Shannon was with us, sitting in the cab of the pickup crushed between the enormous globe of her sister's belly and the silent, hulking presence of our coal miner father who'd been pulled out of the damp, black earth midway through his shift in answer to my emergency call. Since he was going right back to work, he hadn't bothered to clean up or change out of his dirty coveralls. His face and hands were coated with rock dust: the crushed limestone sprayed inside mines to control the combustible coal dust. It gave his skin a bluish-white pallor, like someone who'd been frozen solid and dug out of a snowdrift.<br><br> Shannon was this girl's age and full of the same sort of generalized contempt and misplaced confidence in her ability to not care about anything as long as she told herself nothing was worth caring about, but I remember she looked worried that day as I climbed down out of the truck wincing and breathing funny and cradling the baby still inside me. I couldn't tell if she was afraid for me or afraid for herself because she was going home with dad alone.<br><br> "I don't believe in slavery," I tell the girl. "Besides, maybe he wants to stay with you."<br><br> "I don't think so."<br><br> "I think he's pretty attached to you."<br><br> We both look at the boy this time. He doesn't have the exuberance of most children his age. He hasn't been fidgeting or whining or trying to get away. He stares back at us with the endlessly patient gaze of a sheep waiting at the gate to be let out or let in.<br><br> "But he ain't mine. He's my mom's," she says.<br><br> "He doesn't belong to you or your mom."<br><br> I walk around to the driver's side of my car. They follow me.<br><br> "He's not a dog. He's a person. You can't own another person. Although another person can own you. You'll learn about that when you start dating."<br><br> "I already date."<br><br> "Okay, enough." I hold up my hands in a sign of defeat. "This is more information than I need. If you don't have any money, what else do you have?"<br><br> She opens up her grimy purse, pink with a jeweled kitten on it. I would have killed for a purse like that when I was her age although I never would have taken it outside the house for fear E.J. or some of the other guys would have made fun of me for being a sissy.<br><br> She pokes through the meager contents with the tips of her fingers, which are polished in chipped purple: a cracked pink plastic Barbie wallet, a lipstick, a comb, a piece of notebook paper folded into a small square, a lighter shaped like a pig, and a handful of what looks like ordinary gravel.<br><br> She gestures with her head toward the boy.<br><br> "Kenny collects rocks."<br><br> I take the lighter and flick it on. The flames come out the pig's nose.<br><br> "The lighter," I state.<br><br> "No way. I love that lighter. I just stole . . . I just bought it with my own money inside."<br><br> "No lighter, no ride."<br><br> It's her turn to size me up. She looks me over. I wonder what she thinks about my outfit, if she's being more generous than I was with hers. Ancient scuffed Frye harness boots, long bare legs, a camouflage miniskirt, olive drab tank top, cheap drugstore sunglasses, and a pink Stetson that Clay gave me two years ago as a Mother's Day gag gift that I was never supposed to wear: looks like she was dressed by a Vietnam vet with a penchant for banging middle-aged cowgirls.<br><br> Her gaze leaves me and runs over the car. jolly mount cab is written on both sides but about a month ago, someone blacked out jolly and cab on the driver's side door and added the word me.<br><br> It now reads mount me.<br><br> I don't have any idea who the vandal is. I'm sure it was nothing personal. I've even taken my time getting it fixed. I tell myself it's because I don't have the money, but part of the reason is simple admiration and encouragement for the creative thought process behind it.<br><br> When E.J. and I were in sixth grade and the Union Hall was still standing and hosting community events, a square dancing club called The Naughty Pines came to town to put on an exhibition. E.J. and I switched two letters and the next day the marquee read tonight only: the naughty penis.<br><br> We thought we were the two most brilliant people alive.<br><br> It was inevitable that we would be caught, since we bragged openly about what we had done. Eventually word spread throughout the school, and we were sent to the principal's office. I never did understand why our teachers were allowed to become involved, since the act didn't occur on school property or during school hours, but I guess they believed that, since I didn't have a mom to teach me right from wrong, they were responsible for disciplining me.<br><br> Apparently, I've passed the girl's inspection because she hands me the lighter and opens the back door.<br><br> My cell rings.<br><br> "Jolly Mount Cab," I answer.<br><br> "I need a cab to drive me from Harrisburg to Jolly Mount," a man's voice greets me. "There's not a single cab company here that will do it. One of the drivers I spoke to recommended you."<br><br> "What'd he say?"<br><br> "He said he thought you'd take the job."<br><br> "No, that's not what I mean. What'd he say about me?"<br><br> "He said he thought you'd take the job," he repeats.<br><br> The girl crawls inside the car and motions for her brother to follow. Once he's seated beside her she makes him fasten his seat belt but doesn't put on her own.<br><br> "What'd he really say about me?" I ask him.<br><br> A brief silence.<br><br> "He said you're attractive, although he didn't use the word 'attractive,' but I think that was the point he was trying to make."<br><br> "Does that make you more eager to have me drive you?"<br><br> "I doubt I'd be interested in you in that way."<br><br> "Why not? Are you gay? Faithful? Celibate? Impotent?"<br><br> "Picky."<br><br> "Fair enough," I say.<br><br> I'm trying to figure him out. His manner of speaking sounds almost rehearsed. There's not the slightest trace of any kind of a regional accent in his voice; he enunciates too well, and he uses very little inflection. He talks rapidly but he's also fond of dramatic pauses. He's sort of a cross between Captain Kirk and the guy who did the English voice-overs for all the old Kung Fu movies.<br><br> My guess is he grew up talking one way and puts a lot of effort into not talking that way anymore.<br><br> "Where are you exac...</p><h2>Oathbreaker</h2><p>In this storming tale of courage and heroism, a band of dwarf adventurers make a doomed attempt to reconquer the lost dwarf hold of Karak Varn.</p><p>Nick Kyme hails from Grimsby, a small town on the east coast of England.

This acclaimed memoir--nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award--traces Merrill&#39;s painful yet often hilarious life as a young man. &#34;Stands with Merrill&#39;s finest work.&#34;-- Los Angeles Times Book Review.</p><p>Eminent poet James Merrill opens his life to us in a memoir that puts wit, sensibility, and elegance of mind to the service of unflinching autobiographical truth.$25. LIT As much a storyteller as a poet, Merrill, the Pulitzer Prize-winning heir to the Merrill-Lynch fortune, delights with this graceful account of a 30-month stay in Europe in the 1950s that was to become the pivotal time of exploration and self-discovery. In his mid-twenties, after having his first book of poems published, Merrill and the "love of his life" depart for Greece and Italy. When the passion disappears, Merrill stays on, attending concerts, meeting and entertaining friends, undergoing psychoanalysis, and, most importantly, writing poetry. His narrative style is so flowing that the account reads more like a novel than a memoir. With refreshing honesty and perception, Merrill introduces us to a young man full of self-doubt, incredible ego, and a large capacity for human kindness. Most libraries with poetry collections will want this. Because of its wonderful sense of immediacy and story, it is also recommended for libraries serving avid biography readers.

She has been a lecturer in Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham and a Research Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Warwick. She is the author of The Most Radical Gesture and Zeros + Ones. She lives in Birmingham.The two books under review report on the use of various drugs, from opium to ecstasy, throughout the ages. With Sisters of the Extreme, Palmer and Horowitz (coeditors of Moksha: Aldous Huxley's Classic Writings on Psychedelics and the Visionary Experience) have updated their 1982 anthology, Shaman Woman, Mainline Lady. Following a historical introduction, the authors present firsthand accounts of women on drugs, from Victorian times to the present. Among their subjects are Jane Addams, Edith Wharton, Caresse Crosby, Billie Holiday, Laura Huxley, Anita Hoffman, Bonnie Bremser, and Susan Sontag. Their stories range from sordid tales of heroin addiction and prostitution to quests for spiritual enlightenment. Through these selections, the editors succeed in demonstrating that women's experiences with drugs are "more varied and complex than stereotypes suggest." With over 120 illustrations, this lively introduction to a relatively neglected topic is recommended for larger public and academic libraries. The title of Plant's (Zeroes &amp; Ones) book is somewhat misleading. While it discusses various writers associated with drugs, from Thomas De Quincey and Charles Baudelaire to William S. Burroughs and Henri Michaux, it quickly veers off into broader matters. More of a cultural history, the book examines the role of drugs in society from a variety of disciplines, including history, political science, psychology, philosophy, medicine, and economics. The topics covered range from Sigmund Freud on cocaine to Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari on capitalism and schizophrenia, from the CIA's involvement in drug trafficking to the neurochemistry of psychoactive substances, and from the connections between drugs and witchcraft to an examination of the marketing of Coca-Cola. Plant has a gift for synthesis and manages to weave the diverse threads of her study into a coherent and generally readable book. Recommended for academic libraries.DWilliam Gargan, Brooklyn Coll.

A left-leaning young Oxford academic and his barrister girlfriend take an off-peak holiday on the Caribbean island of Antigua. By seeming chance they bump into a Russian millionaire called Dima who owns a peninsula and a diamond-encrusted gold watch. He also has a tattoo on his right thumb, and wants a game of tennis. What else he wants propels the young lovers on a tortuous journey through Paris to a safe house in the Swiss Alps, to the murkiest cloisters of the City of London and its unholy alliance with Britain&#39;s Intelligence Establishment.</p><p>John le Carre was born in 1931.

His recent novels include A Most Wanted Man, Our Kind of Traitor and A Delicate Truth.<b>1</b><p>At seven o'clock of a Caribbean morning, on the island of Antigua, one Peregrine Makepiece, otherwise known as Perry, an all-round amateur athlete of distinction and until recently tutor in English literature at a distinguished Oxford college, played three sets of tennis against a muscular, stiff-backed, bald, brown-eyed Russian man of dignified bearing in his middle fifties called Dima. How this match came about was quickly the subject of intense examination by British agents professionally disposed against the workings of chance. Yet the events leading up to it were on Perry's side blameless.</p><p>The dawning of his thirtieth birthday three months previously had triggered a life-change in him that had been building up for a year or more without his being aware of it. Seated head in hands at eight o'clock in the morning in his modest Oxford rooms, after a seven-mile run that had done nothing to ease his sense of calamity, he had searched his soul to know just what the first third of his natural life had achieved, apart from providing him with an excuse for not engaging in the world beyond the city's dreaming spires.</p><p>*</p><p>Why?</p><p>To any outward eye, his was the ultimate academic success story. The State-educated son of secondary-school teachers arrives in Oxford from London University laden with academic honours and takes up a three-year post awarded him by an ancient, rich, achievement-driven college. His first name, traditionally the property of the English upper classes, derives from a rabble-rousing Methodist prelate of the nineteenth century named Arthur Peregrine of Huddersfield.</p><p>In the term time, when he isn't teaching, he distinguishes himself as a cross-country runner and sportsman. On his spare evenings he helps out in a local youth club. In vacations he conquers difficult peaks and Most Serious climbs. Yet when his college offers him a permanent Fellowship&#x2014;or to his present soured way of thinking, imprisonment for life&#x2014;he baulks.</p><p>Again: why?</p><p>Last term he had delivered a series of lectures on George Orwell under the title 'A Stifled Britain?' and his rhetoric had alarmed him. Would Orwell have believed it possible that the same overfed voices which had haunted him in the 1930s, the same crippling incompetence, addiction to foreign wars and assumptions of entitlement, were happily in place in 2009?</p><p>Receiving no response from the blank student faces staring up at him, he had supplied it for himself: <i>no</i>, Orwell would emphatically <i>not</i> have believed it. Or if he had, he would have taken to the streets. He would have smashed some serious glass.</p><p>*</p><p>It was a topic he had thrashed out mercilessly with Gail, his longstanding girlfriend, as they lay in her bed after a birthday supper at the flat in Primrose Hill that she had part-inherited from her otherwise penniless father.</p><p>'I don't like dons and I don't like being one myself. I don't like academia and if I never have to wear a bloody gown again, I'll feel a free man,' he had ranted at the gold-brown hair clustered comfortably on his shoulder.</p><p>And receiving no reply beyond a sympathetic purr:</p><p>'Hammering on about Byron, Keats and Wordsworth to a bunch of bored undergraduates whose highest ambition is to get a degree, get laid, and get rich? Done it. Been there. Fuck it.'</p><p>And raising the odds:</p><p>'About the only thing that would <i>really</i> keep me in this country is a bloody revolution.'</p><p>And Gail, a sparky young barrister on the rise, blessed with looks and a quick tongue&#x2014;sometimes a little too quick for her own comfort as well as Perry's&#x2014;assured him that no revolution would be complete without him.</p><p>Both were <i>de facto</i> orphans. If Perry's late parents had been the soul of high-minded Christian socialist abstinence, Gail's were the other thing. Her father, a sweetly useless actor, had died prematurely of alcohol, sixty cigarettes a day and a misplaced passion for his wayward wife. Her mother, an actress but less sweet, had vanished from the family home when Gail was thirteen, and was reputed to be living the simple life on the Costa Brava with a second cameraman.</p><p>*</p><p>Perry's initial reaction to his life-decision to shake the dust of academia from his feet&#x2014;irrevocable, like all Perry's life-decisions&#x2014;was to return to his grass roots. The only son of Dora and Alfred would put himself where their convictions had been. He would begin his teaching career all over again at the point where they had been forced to abandon theirs.</p><p>He would stop playing the intellectual high-flyer, sign up for an honest-to-God teacher-training course and, in their image, qualify as a secondary-school teacher in one of his country's most deprived areas.</p><p>He would teach set subjects, and any sport they cared to throw at him, to children who needed him as a lifeline to self-fulfilment rather than as a ticket to middle-class prosperity.</p><p>But Gail was not as alarmed by this prospect as perhaps he intended her to be. For all his determination to be at the <i>hard centre of life</i>, there remained other unreconciled versions of him, and Gail was on familiar terms with most of them:</p><p>Yes, there was Perry the self-punishing student at London University where they had first met, who in the mould of T. E. Lawrence had taken his bicycle to France in the vacations and ridden it until he keeled over with exhaustion.</p><p>And yes, there was Perry the alpine adventurer, the Perry who could run no race and play no game, from seven-a-side rugby to pass the parcel with her nephews and nieces at Christmas time, without a compulsive need to win.</p><p>But there was also Perry the closet sybarite who treated himself to unpredictable bursts of luxury before hurrying back to his garret. And this was the Perry who stood on the best tennis court at the best recession-hit resort in Antigua on that early May morning before the sun got too high to play, with the Russian Dima one side of the net and Perry the other, and Gail wearing a swimsuit and a broad-brimmed floppy hat and a silky cover-up that covered very little, sitting amid an unlikely assembly of dead-eyed spectators, some dressed in black, who appeared to have sworn a collective oath not to smile, not to speak, and not to express any interest in the match they were being compelled to watch.</p><p>*</p><p>It was a lucky chance, in Gail's opinion, that the Caribbean adventure had been planned in advance of Perry's impulsive life-decision. Its inception dated back to darkest November when his father had fallen victim to the same cancer that had carried off his mother two years earlier, leaving Perry in a state of modest affluence. Not holding with inherited wealth, and being in two minds as to whether he should give all he had to the poor, Perry dithered. But after a campaign of attrition mounted by Gail, they had settled for a once-in-a-lifetime bargain tennis holiday in the sun.</p><p>And no holiday could have been better planned, as it turned out, for by the time they had embarked on it, even bigger decisions were staring them in the face:</p><p>What should Perry do with his life, and should they do it together?</p><p>Should Gail give up the Bar and step blindly into the azure yonder with him, or should she continue to pursue her meteoric career in London?</p><p>Or might it be time to admit that her career was no more meteoric than most young barristers' careers, and should she therefore get herself pregnant, which was what Perry was forever urging her to do?</p><p>And if Gail, either out of impishness or self-defence, had a habit of turning large questions into little ones, there remained no doubt that the two of them were separately and together at life's crossroads with some pretty heavy thinking to do, and that a holiday in Antigua looked like providing the ideal setting in which to do it.</p><p>*</p><p>Their flight was delayed, with the result that they didn't check into their hotel till after midnight. Ambrose, the resort's ubiquitous major-domo, showed them to their cabin. They rose late and by the time they had breakfasted on their balcony the sun was too hot for tennis. They swam on a three-quarters-empty beach, had a solitary lunch by the pool, made languorous love in the afternoon, and at six in the evening presented themselves at the pro's shop, rested, happy, and eager for a game.</p><p>Seen from a distance, the resort was no more than a cluster of white cottages scattered along a mile-wide horseshoe of proverbial talcum-powder sand. Two promontories of rock strewn with scrub forest marked its extremities. Between them ran a coral reef and a line of fluorescent buoys to ward off nosy motor yachts. And on hidden terraces wrested from the hillside lay the resort's championship-standard tennis courts. Meagre stone steps wound between flowering shrubs to the front door of the pro's shop. Once through it, you entered tennis heaven, which was why Perry and Gail had chosen the place.</p><p>There were five courts and one centre court. Competition balls were kept in green refrigerators. Competition silver cups in glass cases bore the names of champions of yesteryear and Mark, the overweight Australian pro, was one of them.</p><p>'So what sort of level are we looking at here, if I may inquire?' he asked with heavy gentility, taking in without comment the quality of Perry's battle-scarred racquets, his thick white socks and worn but serviceable tennis shoes, and Gail's neckline.</p><p>For two people past their first youth but still in the bloom of life, Perry and Gail made a strikingly attractive pair. Nature had provided Gail with long, shapely legs and arms, high, small breasts, a lissome body, English skin, fine gold hair and a smile to light the gloomiest corners of life. Perry had a different sort of Englishness, being lank and at first sight dislocated, with a long neck and prominent Adam's apple. His stride was ungainly, he seemed to topple and his ears protruded. At his State school he had been awarded the nickname of Giraffe, until those unwise enough to use it learned their lesson. But with manhood he had acquired&#x2014;unconsciously, which only made it more impressive&#x2014;a precarious but undoubted grace. He had a mop of brown curls, a wide, freckled forehead, and large, bespectacled eyes that gave out an air of angelic perplexity.</p><p>Not trusting Perry to blow his own trumpet, and protective of him as always, Gail took the pro's question upon herself.</p><p>'Perry plays qualifiers for Queen's and he got into the main draw once too, didn't you? You actually made it to the Masters. And that was after breaking his leg skiing and not playing for six months,' she added proudly.</p><p>'And you, madam, if I may make so bold?' Mark the obsequious pro inquired, with a little more spin on the 'madam' than Gail cared for.</p><p>'I'm his rabbit,' she replied coolly, to which Perry said, 'Sheer bollocks,' and the Australian sucked his teeth, shook his heavy head in disbelief and thumbed the messy pages of his ledger.</p><p>'Well, I've got one pair here might do you good people. They're a sight too classy for my other guests, I'll tell you that right now. Not that I've a vast selection of humanity to choose from, frankly. Maybe you four should give each other a whirl.'</p><p>Their opponents turned out to be an Indian honeymoon couple from Mumbai. The centre court was taken, but court 1 was free. Soon a handful of passers-by and players from other courts had drifted over to watch the four of them warm up: fluid strokes from the baseline casually returned, passing shots that nobody ran for, the unanswered smash from the net. Perry and Gail won the toss, Perry gave first serve to Gail who twice double-faulted and they lost the game. The Indian bride followed her. Play remained sedate.</p><p>It wasn't till Perry began serving that the quality of his play became apparent. His first serve had height and power, and when it went in, there wasn't much anyone could do about it. He served four in a row. The crowd grew, the players were young and good-looking, the ball boys discovered new heights of energy. Towards the end of the first set, Mark the pro casually turned out to take a look, stayed for three games, then with a thoughtful frown returned to his shop.</p><p>After a long second set, the score was one set each. The third and final set reached 4 &#x2013; 3, with Perry and Gail having the edge. But if Gail was inclined to hold back, Perry was by now in full cry, and the match ended without the Indian couple winning another game.</p><p>The crowd drifted away. The four lingered to exchange compliments, fix a return and maybe catch a drink in the bar this evening? You bet. The Indians departed, leaving Perry and Gail to gather up their spare racquets and pullovers.</p><p>As they did so, the Australian pro returned to the court bringing with him a muscular, erect, huge-chested, completely bald man wearing a diamond-encrusted gold Rolex wristwatch and grey tracksuit bottoms kept up by a drawstring tied in a bow at his midriff.</p><p>*</p><p>Why Perry should have spotted the bow at his midriff first and the rest of the man afterwards is easily explained. He was in the act of changing his elderly but comfortable tennis shoes for a pair of beach shoes with rope soles, and when he heard his name called he was still bent double. Therefore he lifted his long head slowly, the way tall, angular men do, and registered first a pair of leather espadrilles on small, almost feminine feet set piratically apart, then a couple of stocky, tracksuited calves in grey; and, coming up, the drawstring bow that kept the trousers aloft, double-tied as such a bow should be, given its considerable area of responsibility.</p><p>And above the bow-line, a belly of finest crimson cotton blouse encasing a massive torso that seemed not to know its stomach from its chest, and rising to an Eastern-style collar that if fastened would have made a cut-down version of a clerical dog-collar, except that there was no way it could have accommodated the muscular neck inside it.</p><p>And above the collar, tipped to one side in appeal, eyebrows raised in invitation, the creaseless face of a fifty-something man with soulful brown eyes beaming a dolphin smile at him. The absence of creases did not suggest inexperience, rather the opposite. It was a face that to Perry the outdoor adventurer seemed cast for life: the face, he told Gail much later, of a formed man, another definition that he aspired to himself, but for all his manly striving did not feel he had yet attained.</p><p>'Perry, allow me to present my good friend and patron, Mr <i>Dima</i> from Russia,' said Mark, injecting a ring of ceremony into his unctuous voice. 'Dima thought you played a pretty nifty match out there, am I right, sir? As a fine connoisseur of the game of tennis, he's been watching you highly appreciatively, I think I may say, Dima.'</p><p>'Wanna game?' Dima inquired, without taking his brown, apologetic gaze off Perry, who by now was hovering awkwardly at his full height.</p><p>'Hi,' said Perry, a bit breathlessly, and shoved out a sweated hand. Dima's was the hand of an artisan turned to fat, tattooed with a small star or asterisk on the second knuckle of the thumb. 'And this is Gail Perkins, my partner in crime,' he added, feeling a need to slow the pace a bit.</p><p>But before Dima could respond, Mar...</p></p><h2>Winning Your Wife Back Before It&#39;s Too Late</h2><p><p>Each year more than five-million couples separate in the United States and almost 1.2 million more couples divorce.

It was a job of work, and I did it as well as I could, and that was that. But now, you see, it has no necessity except itself. And, of course, it's hard; it's always been hard, and it's getting harder. So when I'm stuck I think, this isn't my livelihood, and it isn't great art, it's only detective stories. You read them and write them for fun." Is this a clue to the mystery of why Dorothy L. Sayers put aside her 13th full-length Lord Peter novel in 1938 and never finished it? She had made lots of money, and was much more interested in translating Dante and writing about religion. Or is it another excellent novelist, Jill Paton Walsh, speculating--in a perfect imitation of Sayers's voice--on what might have happened? Walsh was invited by the estate of Sayers's illegitimate son, Anthony Fleming, to finish <i>Thrones, Dominations</i>. She has done a splendid job, certain to please Sayers loyalists on the "dorothyl" listserv as well as those new to the Wimsey canon. Lord Peter has been made much more human and interesting by marriage; Harriet is a wise and acerbic companion; and the story, about the murders of two beautiful young women involved with a theatrical producer, is full of twists and connivance. There's also a fascinating subplot involving the soon-to-abdicate King Edward VII and a country on the brink of World War II. Earlier Wimseys in paperback include <i>The Five Red Herrings</i>, <i>Gaudy Night</i>, <i>Murder Must Advertise</i>, and <i>Unnatural Death</i>. Books in print by Walsh include a mystery called <i>A Piece of Justice</i> and a novel, <i>The Serpentine Cave</i>.Praise for <i>Thrones, Dominations</i>:<p> "Engrossing, intelligent, and provocative." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p> "Extraordinary...it is impossible to tell where Dorothy L. Sayers ends and Jill Paton Walsh begins." --Ruth Rendell, <i>The London Sunday Times</i></p><p> "[Walsh] has done a splendid job-certain to please the legions of Sayers loyalists as well as readers new to the Wimsey canon." --<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p></p><h2>Operation BUFFALO: USMC Fight for the DMZ</h2><p>Vividly chronicles the efforts of the U.S. Marines to defend the DMZ in 1967, describing the hardships of these undersupplied troops as they faced attacks from the North Vietnamese. Reprint.</p><p>As vivid and involving as his other unit histories of the Vietnam War (e.g., Into Laos , LJ 9/15/86; Battle for Hue , LJ 3/15/84), this volume takes the reader into a well-planned and -executed ambush of Bravo Company south of the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone--the Marines joked that it stood for "Dead Marine Zone"). North Vietnamese forces had carefully plotted artillery points in the area and then wore captured Marine gear to confuse their victims. A third of Bravo was lost in just a few hours, and when reinforcements were helicoptered in, they came under deadly artillery fire. Their objective, reclaiming their dead, went on for two more days and more casualties, and on July 14, 1967 when the operation was declared completed, everything was (tactically) the same as before. The courage, fear, sacrifice, and pain are all here in an unsentimental style that works better than heroic blood-spilling tales ever could to describe the terrible excesses of combat.

Rubbed at the extremities. Profusely illustrated throughout.</p><p>Douglas Druick is Curator of Prints, Drawings and European Painting, and Peter Kort Zegers is Research Curator at the Art Institute of Chicago. Andreas Bluhm is Head of Exhibitions and Louis van Tilborgh is Curator of Paintings at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam.To accompany the Art Institute of Chicago blockbuster van Gogh and Gauguin exhibit, here's a blockbuster book, with reproductions of such sensuous beauty that they are likely to convert even nonfans of the squabbling yet eternally linked pair. This book's subtitle is a translation of a phrase van Gogh used, more accurately rendered as "The Studio in Southern France," where van Gogh and Gauguin were in close contact, inspiring and antagonizing one another in a way that has fascinated generations of poets, playwrights, screenwriters and even art historians. The most famous van Gogh paintings, like Starry Night and Sunflowers, are put into context here, and there is room also for early, lesser-known works. Four major chapters "Origins," "Encounters," "South Versus North," "The Studio of the South" are followed by a chapter of letters exchanged by the two artists; a "coda" about Gauguin in the tropics, after van Gogh's famous ear-cutting incident broke up their partnership; and a technical appendix with results from lab investigations of canvas fibers and paint chemistry that help to date the works. In clear art historical prose, the painters' motivations are pointed out, such as van Gogh's portrait of Gauguin seen from behind: "In no other instance did Vincent decline to confront a sitter in this way." Two self-portraits, done simultaneously for a friend named Paul Laval, are cogently contrasted, with van Gogh's depiction of his own face showing "a scowl of concern and irritation, his green-eyed gaze skittish..." whereas Gauguin's view of himself shows "watchful, almost smug self-possession." This kind of lively character analysis, as well as art historical smarts, will make this a prestigious title for anyone even vaguely interested in modern French painting, but the 510 illustrations (over 300 in color) are the stars of the show here. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Walt Disney&#39;s Pinocchio</h2><p>Brought to life by the Blue Fairy, Pinocchio, the wooden puppet, finally has his wish of becoming a real live boy come true, but his mischievousness and his penchant for lying could ruin his dreams.</p><p></p><h2>Pandora in the Crimson Shell: Ghost Urn Vol. 4</h2><p><p>The planet is in a constant state of tumult.

From the Village sprung American socialism, gay liberation, the YMCA, the American Civil Liberties Union, <i>The Reader's Digest</i>, the phrase "I heard it through the grapevine," the Colt .45 revolver, and America's first night court, for starters. It was in the Village where Kahlil Gibran wrote <i>The Prophet</i> and the buffalo nickel was designed. Wetzsteon is primarily interested in the place between the years 1910 (when, he says, it became a "self-conscious bohemian and radical community") and 1960, when cultural boundaries "blurred" and the "hegemony of 'the normal'" disappeared. This is not a "walking tour" of famous hangouts so much as a portrait built on a chronological series of richly detailed biographies of Village denizens renowned, notorious, and relatively obscure, including Max Eastman, E.E. Cummings, Jackson Pollock and other abstract expressionists, a Who's Who of American feminists, Eugene O'Neill, and Mabel Dodge. Wetzsteon, who died in 1998, revels in the Village's inherent chaos, contradictions, and mutation, and never succumbs to "golden age" nostalgia. As his daughter writes in an afterword, "the Village is dead; long live the Village." <i>Republic of Dreams</i>, eminently readable, unflaggingly perceptive, and immaculately researched, is, arguably, the seminal study to date of America's most fertile literary, artistic, and political geographical dot. <i>--H.

Her husband drove her to work in his tan Trabant 500. The graceful old streets of<br>central Berlin still had gaps from wartime bombing, except where new concrete buildings stood up like ill-matched false teeth. Hans was thinking about his job as he drove. &#x201c;The courts serve the judges, the lawyers, the police, the government&#x2014;everyone except the victims of crime,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;This is to be expected in Western capitalist countries, but under Communism the courts ought surely to serve the people. My colleagues don&#x2019;t seem to realize that.&#x201d; Hans worked for the Ministry of Justice.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been married almost a year, and I&#x2019;ve known you for two, but<br>I&#x2019;ve never met one of your colleagues,&#x201d; Rebecca said.</p><p>&#x201c;They would bore you,&#x201d; he said immediately. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all lawyers.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Any women among them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Not in my section, anyway.&#x201d; Hans&#x2019;s job was administration:<br>appointing judges, scheduling trials, managing courthouses. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to meet them, all the same.&#x201d;</p><p>Hans was a strong man who had learned to rein himself in. Watching him, Rebecca saw in his eyes a familiar flash of anger at her insistence. He controlled it by an effort of will. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll arrange something,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Perhaps we&#x2019;ll all go to a bar one evening.&#x201d;</p><p>Hans had been the first man Rebecca met who matched up to her father. He was confident and authoritative, but he always listened to her. He had a good job&#x2014;not many people had a car of their own in East Germany&#x2014;and men who worked in the government were usually hardline Communists, but Hans, surprisingly, shared Rebecca&#x2019;s political skepticism. Like her father he was tall, handsome, and well dressed. He was the man she had been waiting for.</p><p>Only once during their courtship had she doubted him, briefly. They had been in a minor car crash. It had been wholly the fault of the other driver, who had come out of a side street without stopping. Such things happened every day, but Hans had been mad with rage. Although the damage to the two cars was minimal, he had called the police, shown them his Ministry of Justice identity card, and had the other driver arrested for dangerous driving and taken off to jail.</p><p>Afterward he had apologized to Rebecca for losing his temper. She had been scared by his vindictiveness, and had come close to ending their relationship. But he had explained that he had not been his normal self, due to pressure at work, and she had believed him. Her faith had been justified: he had never done such a thing again.</p><p>When they had been dating for a year, and sleeping together most weekends for six months, Rebecca wondered why he did not ask her to marry him. They were not kids: she had then been twenty-eight, he thirty-three. So she had proposed to him. He had been startled, but said yes.</p><p>Now he pulled up outside her school. It was a modern building, and well equipped: the Communists were serious about education. Outside the gates, five or six older boys were standing under a tree, smoking cigarettes. Ignoring their stares, Rebecca kissed Hans on the lips. Then she got out.</p><p>The boys greeted her politely, but she felt their yearning adolescent eyes on her figure as she splashed through the puddles in the school yard.</p><p>Rebecca came from a political family. Her grandfather had been a Social Democrat member of the Reichstag, the national parliament, until Hitler came to power. Her mother had been a city councilor, also for the Social Democrats, during East Berlin&#x2019;s brief postwar period of democracy. But East Germany was a Communist tyranny now, and Rebecca saw no point in engaging in politics. So she channeled her idealism into teaching, and hoped that the next generation would be less dogmatic, more compassionate, smarter.</p><p>In the staff room she checked the emergency timetable on the notice board. Most of her classes were doubled today, two groups of pupils crammed into one room. Her subject was Russian, but she also had to teach an English class. She did not speak English, though she had picked up a smattering from her British grandmother, Maud, still feisty at seventy.</p><p>This was the second time Rebecca had been asked to teach an English class, and she began to think about a text. The first time, she had used a leaflet handed out to American soldiers, telling them how to get on with Germans: the pupils had found it hilarious, and they had learned a lot too. Today perhaps she would write on the blackboard the words of a song they knew, such as &#x201c;The Twist&#x201d;&#x2014;played all the time on American Forces Network radio&#x2014;and get them to translate it into German. It would not be a conventional lesson, but it was the best she could do.</p><p>The school was desperately short of teachers because half the staff had emigrated to West Germany, where salaries were three hundred marks a month higher and people were free. The story was the same in most schools in East Germany. And it was not just teachers. Doctors could double their earnings by moving west. Rebecca&#x2019;s mother, Carla, was head of nursing at a large East Berlin hospital, and she was tearing her hair out at the scarcity of both nurses and doctors. The story was the same in industry and even the armed forces. It was a national crisis.</p><p>As Rebecca was scribbling the lyrics of &#x201c;The Twist&#x201d; in a notebook, trying to remember the line about &#x201c;my little sis,&#x201d; the deputy head came into the staff room. Bernd Held was probably Rebecca&#x2019;s best friend outside her family. He was a slim, dark-haired man of forty, with a livid scar across his forehead where a shard of flying shrapnel had struck him while he was defending the Seelow Heights in the last days of the war. He taught physics, but he shared Rebecca&#x2019;s interest in Russian literature, and they ate their lunchtime sandwiches together a couple of times a week. &#x201c;Listen, everybody,&#x201d; Bernd said. &#x201c;Bad news, I&#x2019;m afraid. Anselm has left us.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a murmur of surprise. Anselm Weber was the head teacher. He was a loyal Communist&#x2014;heads had to be. But it seemed his principles had been overcome by the appeal of West German prosperity and liberty.</p><p>Bernd went on: &#x201c;I will be taking his place until a new head can be appointed.&#x201d; Rebecca and every other teacher in the school knew that Bernd himself should have got the job, if ability had been what counted; but Bernd was ruled out because he would not join the Socialist Unity Party, the SED&#x2014;the Communist Party in all but name.</p><p>For the same reason, Rebecca would never be a head teacher. Anselm had pleaded with her to join the party, but it was out of the question. For her it would be like checking herself into a lunatic asylum and pretending all the other inmates were sane.</p><p>As Bernd detailed the emergency arrangements, Rebecca wondered when the school would get its new head. A year from now? How long would this crisis go on? No one knew.</p><p>Before the first lesson she glanced into her pigeonhole, but it was empty. The mail had not yet arrived. Perhaps the postman had gone to West Germany, too.</p><p>The letter that would turn her life upside down was still on its way. </p><p>She taught her first class, discussing the Russian poem &#x201c;The Bronze Horseman&#x201d; with a large group seventeen and eighteen years old. This was a lesson she had given every year since she started teaching. As always, she guided the pupils to the orthodox Soviet analysis, explaining that the conflict between personal interest and public duty was resolved,<br>by Pushkin, in favor of the public.</p><p>At lunchtime she took her sandwich to the head&#x2019;s office and sat down across the big desk from Bernd. She looked at the shelf of cheap pottery busts: Marx, Lenin, and East German Communist leader Walter Ulbricht. Bernd followed her gaze and smiled. &#x201c;Anselm is a sly one,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;For years he pretended to be a true believer, and now&#x2014; zoom, he&#x2019;s off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you tempted to leave?&#x201d; Rebecca asked Bernd. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re divorced, no children&#x2014;you have no ties.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked around, as if wondering whether someone might be listening; then he shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve thought about it&#x2014;who hasn&#x2019;t?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;How about you? Your father works in West Berlin any way, doesn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. He has a factory making television sets. But my mother is determined to stay in the East. She says we must solve our problems, not run away from them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve met her. She&#x2019;s a tiger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the truth. And the house we live in has been in her family for generations.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about your husband?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s dedicated to his job.&#x201d;<br><br></p><p>So I don&#x2019;t have to worry about losing you. Good.&#x201d; </p><p>Rebecca said: &#x201c;Bernd&#x2014;&#x201d; Then she hesitated.</p><p>&#x201c;Spit it out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can I ask you a personal question?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You left your wife because she was having an affair.&#x201d; </p><p>Bernd stiffened, but he answered: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How did you find out?&#x201d;</p><p>Bernd winced, as if at a sudden pain.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you mind me asking?&#x201d; Rebecca said anxiously. &#x201c;Is it too personal?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind telling you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I confronted her, and she admitted it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But what made you suspicious?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A lot of little things&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Rebecca interrupted him. &#x201c;The phone rings, you pick it up, there&#x2019;s a silence for a few seconds, then the person at the other end hangs up.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She went on: &#x201c;Your spouse tears a note up small and flushes the shreds down the toilet. At the weekend he&#x2019;s called to an unexpected meeting. In the evening he spends two hours writing something he won&#x2019;t show you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, dear,&#x201d; said Bernd sadly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re talking about Hans.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got a lover, hasn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; She put down her sandwich: she had no appetite. &#x201c;Tell me honestly what you think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>Bernd had kissed her once, four months ago, on the last day of the autumn term. They had been saying good-bye, and wishing one another a happy Christmas, and he had lightly grasped her arm, and bent his head, and kissed her lips. She had asked him not to do it again, ever, and said she would still like to be his friend; and when they had returned to school in January both had pretended it had never happened. He had even told her, a few weeks later, that he had a date with a widow his own age.</p><p>Rebecca did not want to encourage hopeless aspirations, but Bernd was the only person she could talk to, except for her family, and she did not want to worry them, not yet. &#x201c;I was so sure that Hans loved me,&#x201d; she said, and tears came to her eyes. &#x201c;And I love him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps he does love you. Some men just can&#x2019;t resist temptation.&#x201d; </p><p>Rebecca did not know whether Hans found their sex life satisfactory.</p><p>He never complained, but they made love only about once a week, which she believed to be infrequent for newlyweds. &#x201c;All I want is a family of my own, just like my mother&#x2019;s, in which everyone is loved and supported and protected,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I thought I could have that with Hans.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps you still can,&#x201d; said Bernd. &#x201c;An affair isn&#x2019;t necessarily the end of the marriage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In the first year?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s bad, I agree.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What should I do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You must ask him about it. He may admit it, he may deny it; but he&#x2019;ll know that you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And then what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want? Would you divorce him?&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201c;I would never leave. Marriage is a promise. You can&#x2019;t keep a promise only when it suits you. You have to keep it against your inclination. That&#x2019;s what it means.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I did the opposite. You must disapprove of me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t judge you or anyone else. I&#x2019;m just talking about myself. I love my husband and I want him to be faithful.&#x201d;</p><p>Bernd&#x2019;s smile was admiring but regretful. &#x201c;I hope you get your wish.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a good friend.&#x201d;</p><p>The bell rang for the first lesson of the afternoon. Rebecca stood up and put her sandwich back in its paper wrapping. She was not going to eat it, now or later, but she had a horror of throwing food away, like most people who had lived through the war. She touched her damp eyes with a handkerchief. &#x201c;Thank you for listening,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t much comfort.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, you were.&#x201d; She went out.</p><p>As she approached the classroom for the English lesson, she realized she had not worked out the lyrics to &#x201c;The Twist.&#x201d; However, she had been a teacher long enough to improvise. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s heard a record called &#x2018;The Twist&#x2019;?&#x201d; she asked loudly as she walked through the door.</p><p>They all had.</p><p>She went to the blackboard and picked up a stub of chalk. &#x201c;What are the words?&#x201d;</p><p>They all began to shout at once.</p><p>On the board she wrote: &#x201c;Come on, baby, let&#x2019;s do the Twist.&#x201d; Then she said: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that in German?&#x201d;</p><p>For a while she forgot about her troubles.</p><p>She found the letter in her pigeonhole at the midafternoon break. She carried it with her into the staff room and made a cup of instant coffee before opening it. When she read it she dropped her coffee.</p><p>The single sheet of paper was headed: &#x201c;Ministry for State Security.&#x201d; This was the official name for the secret police: the unofficial name was the Stasi. The letter came from a Sergeant Scholz, and it ordered her to present herself at his headquarters office for questioning.</p><p>Rebecca mopped up her spilled drink, apologized to her colleagues, pretended nothing was wrong, and went to the ladies&#x2019; room, where she locked herself in a cubicle. She needed to think before confiding in anyone.</p><p>Everyone in East Germany knew about these letters, and everyone dreaded receiving one. It meant she had done something wrong&#x2014; perhaps something trivial, but it had come to the attention of the watchers. She knew, from what other people said, that there was no point protesting innocence. The police attitude would be that she must be guilty of something, or why would they be questioning her? To suggest they might have made a mistake was to insult their competence, which was another crime.</p><p>Looking again, she saw that her appointment was for five this afternoon.</p><p>What had she done? Her family was deeply suspect, of course. Her father, Werner, was a capitalist, with a factory that the East German government could not touch because it was in West Berlin. Her mother, Carla, was a well-known Social Democrat. Her grandmother, Maud, was the sister of an English earl.</p><p>However, the authorities had not bothered the family for a couple of years, and Rebecca had imagined that her marriage to an official in the Justice Ministry might have gained them a ticket of respectability. Obviously not.</p><p>Had she committed any crimes? She owned a copy of George Orwell&#x2019;s anti-Communist allegory Animal Farm, which was illegal. Her kid brother, Walli, who was fifteen, played the guitar and sang American protest songs such as &#x201c;This Land Is Your Land.&#x201d; Rebecca sometimes went to West Berlin to see exhibitions of abstract painting. Communists were as conservative about art as Victorian matrons.</p><p>Washing her hands, she glanced in the mirror. She did not look scared. She had a straight nose and a strong chin and intense brown eyes. Her unruly dark hair was sharply pulled back. She was tall and statuesque, and some people found her intimidati...</p></p><h2>MciIhenny&#39;s Gold</h2><p><blockquote><p>The story of the powerful McIlhennys of Louisiana, who turned hot peppers into a Tabasco fortune</p></blockquote><p>After the Civil War ended, Edmund McIlhenny, an ambitious and tenacious Louisiana businessman, found himself with few prospects. The South's economy in ruins and his millions of dollars in Confederacy currency worthless, he had no choice but to return with his wife, Mary, to her family home in Avery Island, a former sugar plantation destroyed by Union soldiers.</p><p>To McIlhenny's surprise, the hot peppers he had planted before being forced off the island had flourished. Desperate to start a new business, he chopped up the peppers, combined them with salt and vinegar, and produced the first batch of hot pepper sauce. Or so the story goes. He called the sauce Tabasco.</p><p>In this fascinating history, Jeffrey Rothfeder tells how, from a simple idea&#x2014;the outgrowth of a handful of peppers planted on an isolated island on the Gulf of Mexico&#x2014;a secretive family business emerged that would produce one of the best-known products in the world. In short order, McIlhenny's descendants would turn Tabasco into a gold mine and an icon of pop culture, making it as recognizable as far bigger brands such as Coca-Cola and Kleenex.</p><p>To this day, the McIlhenny Co., still run by a family of matchless characters who believe in a rigid code of family loyalty, clings to tradition and the old ways of doing business. Yet by fiercely protecting its beloved brand and refusing to sell out to big food conglomerates, this family business has run circles around its competitors, churning out annual revenues that have surpassed everyone's expectations. </p><p>A delectable and satisfying read for both Tabasco fans and business buffs, <em>McIlhenny's Gold</em> is the untold story of the continuing success of an eccentric, private company; a lively history of one of the most popular consumer products of all times; and an exploration of our desire to test the limits of human tolerance for fiery foods.</p></p><p><p>A former <em>BusinessWeek</em> editor and national editor at <em>Bloomberg News</em>, Jeffrey Rothfeder has written for publications such as the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Washington Post</em> and has appeared on <em>20/20</em>, <em>Nightline</em>, <em>Today</em>, <em>Good Morning America</em>, and <em>Oprah</em>. He lives in Cortlandt Manor, New York.</p>This intriguing biography of the McIlhenny Tabasco Company, a family business that has refused to go public like its wealthy counterparts, is as spicy an account as it is charming. Author Rothfeder is no stranger to writing about the business world, and his lengthy experience is demonstrated as he thoroughly recounts the creation of the family's treasured Tabasco Sauce and the principals who grew it into an unlikely family-run empire. This enthusiasm is wonderfully realized by celebrated narrator Norman Dietz, who offers a straightforward, unobtrusive reading that makes the McIlhenny company the star of the story. There are no frills, no thrills in Dietz's delivery, but his reading is thoroughly intriguing and inspiring.

The book covers the design and testing of the prototypes in both configurations, the production entry of the basic Su-27 single-seat fighter and the Su-27UB two-seat combat trainer together with the efforts of Sukhoi to keep them up to date with mid-life upgrades to Generation 4++' (Su-35S) level. The operational histories of Su-27 versions including the Su-30/Su-34/Su-35 are also described.</p><p>When the Soviet Navy decided to bolster its fleet with carriers optimized for conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) aircraft, Sukhoi responded by developing the Su-27K, which later entered service as the Su-33, Russia's first operational CTOL shipboard fighter. These naval variants are included in the book as is a chapter describing the story of how China purchased license manufacturing rights for the Su-27 and went on to develop its own versions with indigenous avionics and weapons, including the basic J-11 fighter and the J-15 Flying Shark--a clone of the Su-33.</p><p>The post-Soviet republics included, the Su-27/Su-30/Su-34/Su-35 family has seen service with nearly 20 nations, including places as far apart as Vietnam, Malaysia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Angola, India and Venezuela.</p><p>The book describes in depth the development and operational career of the Su-27 family, including mid-life upgrades and the latest variants, and features detailed fleet lists. Richly illustrated with color photographs, line drawings and color profiles of the various color schemes carried by the type, this is <b>the definitive work</b> on a truly outstanding aircraft.</p></p><p>The amazing &#x2018;Pugachov Cobra&#x2019; maneuver witnessed with awe by many airshow watchers worldwide has been perhaps the most attention-grabbing aspect of the <i>Flanker</i>, but it only goes to illustrate the agility and capabilities of this series of Soviet/Russian fighters, which are fully examined in this volume. <p>Originating in 1960s design studies, the <i>Flanker</i> fourth-generation fighter was a long time in development with the now-familiar Su-27 production version not flying until 1981. It, together with its derivatives, has gone on to enjoy extended production and development in a far greater range of roles than was first envisaged. It has served with the Russian Air Force and Navy as a fighter and bomber and seen combat service, notably in Syria in the campaign against Islamic State. </p><p>It has also achieved notable export success worldwide, from Vietnam to Venezuela, with license production in India and in China, the latter going on to develop and produce their own versions.</p><p>Russian defense experts claim that the generation 4++ single-seat Sukhoi Su-35S, which is regarded as an interim type until the Sukhoi T-50 fifth-generation fighter enters service, can take on the Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptor in air combat.</p><p>As in the standard with this <i>Famous Russian Aircraft</i> series, this volume, mostly extensively updated and greatly expanded from an earlier 2007 edition, includes full development and service histories, production listings, attrition, details of different versions, equipment and technical details, all gleaned by these eminent Russian authors and is fully illustrated with around 1,750 photos, copious line drawings and color artwork, in short, the undisputed &#x2018;go-to&#x2019; on the <i>Flanker</i>.</p>Development of what was to become the world-renowned Su-27 began in the 1960s by the Soviet Union in response to the threat posed by the new fourth generation of American fighters with exceptional range, heavy armament and great agility, but the task was long and arduous with production only beginning in 1982.<p>By the mid 1980s Sukhoi started development of the Su-27M (Su-35) generation 4+ fighter but the demise of the Soviet Union prevented this from entering production. However, the Su-33 shipboard version fared better and continues to serve with the Russian Navy today.</p><p>In the late 1980s the Su-27UB combat trainer was developed into the Su-30 two-seat fighter and this led to the highly successful Su-30MK export version on the 1990s. More recently the single seat Su-35S generation 4++ has entered into service, as has the distinctive side-by-side two-seat Su-34 tactical bomber, which became operational with the Russian Air Force in 2011. </p><p>In all, the Su-27 and its derivatives have seen service with nearly 20 nations and it has seen combat service, notably in the recent Russian operations in Syria.</p><p>This is an extensively revised, much updated and considerably expanded edition of a 2007 title in this <i>Famous Russian Aircraft</i> series and as such describes in unprecedented and extensively-researched detail from original resources the development, variants and operational history of the entire <i>Flanker</i> family.</p><p>With around 1,750 photographs, about 180 line drawings and over 300 specially-commissioned color side views, this work will undoubtedly be the primary reference source on the Flanker family for historians, modelers and enthusiasts alike.</p></p><h2>Winter Carnival (Sweet Valley High Super Editions)</h2><p>Elizabeth Wakefield&#39;s enjoyment of the Winter Carnival, Sweet Valley High&#39;s weekend at a ski resort, is threatened by the inconsiderate attitude of her twin sister, Jessica, and by Jessica&#39;s interference between Elizabeth and her boyfriend</p><p></p><h2>Bible Stories For Adults</h2><p>Morrow unabashedly delves into matters both sacred and secular in this collection of short stories buoyed by his deliciously irreverent wit. Among the dozen selections is the Nebula Award-winning &#x201c;Bible Stories for Adults, No. 17: The Deluge.&#x201d;<br></p><p>James Morrow was born in Philadelphia in 1947. Besides writing, he plays with Lionel electric trains and collects videocassettes of vulgar biblical spectacles.Morrow's <i>Towing Jehovah</i> (1994), which has just won the 1995 World Fantasy Award for best novel, wickedly satirizes orthodox religion by recounting the journey of an oil tanker towing God's immense, decaying corpse to its final resting place at the North Pole. The stories in Morrow's new collection run in a similar vein, deliciously skewering not only Judeo-Christian mythology but other sacred cows of modern society, from capitalism to New Age spiritualism. In the Nebula-winning "Bible Stories for Adults, No. 17: The Deluge," Morrow presents a prostitute who is rescued by the ark's crew from a flood but who shouldn't have survived, for she inevitably helps revive the evils God meant to destroy. "The Confessions of Ebenezer Scrooge" delightfully exposes the flaws of corporate charity when Marley's ghost returns with another round of rebukes for a disconcerted Scrooge. In Bible stories numbers 20 ("The Tower" ) and 31 ("The Covenant" ), respectively, Morrow gives us God's own amendment, in His own words, to the Tower of Babel story and describes a computer's reconstruction of Moses' tablets. Morrow's brand of mordant wit invites comparison with such master satirists as Vonnegut and even Swift, and he deserves to share an audience with them that sprawls beyond the bounds of genre fandom. Not to be missed. (<i>Booklist - Carl Hays</i>)<br><br>Twelve tales, 198494, drawn from various publications, by the author of Towing Jehovah (1994), etc. The main thrust here isn't always biblical, though satire looms large--along with dollops of ironic, iconoclastic, or subversive wit. The dazzlingly effective best of a decidedly superior bunch: A murderously mutinous WW I American infantry private ends up in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with a permanent honor guard; reversing his Babel decision, God gives everyone the power of perfect comprehension--with equally devastating results; a robot civilization adheres to the Darwinian principle of natural selection, despite the manifest impossibility of its applying to them; and the sad story of Gunther Black, a man with multiple personalities so numerous that they form nations--and conduct war! In other notable what-ifs, Moses never receives a replacement set of law tablets; Lincoln considers signing an armistice; Helen decides to put an end to the Trojan War; Ebenezer Scrooge lives out his days as an unregenerate capitalist rascal; and Job realizes he's been duped and demands a rematch. Elsewhere, a dead woman's donated organs yearn to reunite; Noah ponders the possibility of other survivors; and, finally, in a rather silly fable, a farmer's wife gives birth to planet Earth. A splendidly provocative series of engagements for supple and enquiring minds; mandatory for fanatics of any stripe. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)</p><h2>Who Killed Christopher Robin? The Truth behind the Murder of Brian Jones</h2><p>Accompanied by a CD of recordings by Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones and a bogus taped confession staged as a publicity stunt in the early 1980s, this book reveals the identity of what it claims is Jones&#39;s true murderer. The author has built up a record of Jones&#39;s life, his financial position at the time of his death, and a chronology of events in the days and hours leading up to it. A new pathologist&#39;s report and a re-examination of the police evidence corroborate both the stories of those who were present at Jones&#39;s house on the fatal day and a sworn affidavit from the man who witnessed the alleged murderer&#39;s confession.

(c) AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Bottom Feeders: From Free Love To Hard Core - The Rise And Fall Of Jim And Arti</h2><p>In 1973, less than a hundred years after Henry James's Daisy Miller compared the innocence of Americans with the decadence of Europeans, Jim and Artie Mitchell arrived at the Cannes Film Festival for the screening of their magnum opus. When the lights came up and the credits rolled on Behind The Green Door, the French audience showered America's bad-boy pornographers with wild applause. The formerly innocent Americans had returned to teach the Europeans about decadence.<br>Bottom Feeders is the compelling story of how a pair of irreverent brothers, the sons of an Okie cardshark, made pornography one more option in the mainstream consumer marketplace. It is also the story of how their moral disintegration ended in the violent death of Artie at the hands of his brother.<br>Award-winning author John Hubner set out to discover what kind of forces might drive a man to kill his brother. But his examination of the Mitchell story becomes much more than that. Long before mild-mannered Jim burst into Artie's house with his rifle blazing, the Mitchell Brothers had made a name for themselves as counterculture heroes who owned San Francisco's landmark O'Farrell Theatre. Riding the free-love tide of sexual libertarianism, the brothers went from distribution of topless still photos to sexually explicit films and live sex shows that forced authorities to anchor legal rulings in the shifting sands of community standards. Along the way they produced Green Door (which became a mainstream blockbuster), fought seminal court battles, launched the career of famed "Ivory Snow Girl" Marilyn Chambers, were a focal point for underground celebrities like Hunter S. Thompson, and became known as the Peck's Bad Boys of San Francisco, who responded to harassment from the mayor by putting her office number on the theater marquee.<br>But whether you're in the vanguard or the rearguard, porn is a dirty business. Hubner discovers that the morally twisted world of porn often attracts psychologically unstable people who are unable to escape from it. Artie Mitchell himself became the most striking example of this disintegration: an alcoholic and womanizer who never grew up.<br>Bottom Feeders effortlessly interweaves Artie and Jim's story with the social forces that helped shape them, from the Vietnam War to the supercharged rebellious atmosphere of San Francisco in the sixties. And finally we come to understand how two counterculture heroes - and the counterculture itself - burned themselves out.</p><p>Sex, drugs, money, death: The saga of the Mitchell brothers has it all--which, no doubt, is why this is the second book about these trend-setting pornographers, one of whom killed the other, to appear in recent months (a third, by Warren Hinckle and Susan Cheever, has been postponed indefinitely). Happily, Hubner's intensively researched account is every bit as compelling as David McCumber's X-Rated (1992), and complements it nicely. Though Hubner (the Pulitzer-winning San Jose Mercury News journalist who coauthored 1988's superb expos&#x201a; of the Hare Krishnas, Monkey on a Stick) doesn't write with the same explosive flair as McCumber, he livens his straightforward prose with key exclusive interviews, including one with Marilyn Chambers, whom the Mitchells launched into porno superstardom. With input from the Ivory Snow-girl and others, Hubner focuses more tightly than McCumber on the business/artistic aspects of the Mitchells' rise from obscure makers of penny-ante porno loops in the late 60's to rich and notorious creators of the porn classic Behind the Green Door and proprietors of San Francisco's infamous O'Farrell Theater. It's a savvy, sexually explicit report, and also jaw-dropping as the Mitchells' sense of sex as theater unfolds (one O'Farrell innovation was ``The Streets of Paris,'' a room containing a cobblestone street, wrought-iron balustrades, and doorways from which women beckoned men to sex). Hubner's quiet approach doesn't convey the drug-induced madness growing inside Artie Mitchell's head with the same intensity as did McCumber's flaming pages--but Hubner compresses the trial of Jim Mitchell for blowing away his brother into far fewer--and more cogent--pages than did McCumber. And so the Mitchells' story is replayed again, and in the retelling begins to take on the dimensions of another uniquely American myth of talent, excess, and tragedy, one to be put alongside those of JFK, Marilyn, and Elvis. (Twenty-five b&amp;w photos--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Hubner ( Monkey on a Stick ) presents a raw, compellingly lurid account of Jim Mitchell (b. 1943) and his younger brother, Artie (b.1945), who pioneered "mainstream" pornographic films during the 1970s. Raised in an "Okie" family in California's San Joaquin Valley, the brothers started out filming "loops" of topless hippie women in '60s San Francisco, where they later opened the O'Farrell Theater as a venue for their work. As they progressed to more explicit fare, they added plots and creative camera angles as means to justify their movies' artistic merits and thus get around antipornography laws. During their heyday, the brothers tangled with antiporn activists, including Dianne Feinstein (elected to the U.S. Senate last fall) and convicted S &amp; L felon Charles Keating, and gave porn star Marilyn Chambers her start in Behind the Green Door . Hubner concentrates on the Mitchells' headstrong, country-boy mentality as he leads up to their last act: in 1991 Jim fatally shot Artie, who had become a drug addict and alcoholic. Jim was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. In a book that no doubt will receive major local attention, Hubner neither sensationalizes nor flinches from the sordid facts in the lives of these emblematic "pornographers of the flower children." <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Key (Irish Literature)</h2><p><p>In <i>An Eochair</i> (<i>The Key</i>), one of M�irt�n � Cadhain's most Kafkaesque short stories (and one of his longest), J., a 'paper-keeper,' one of the more junior civil servant positions, accidentally locks himself in his office when the key breaks in the lock. The story -- a mixture of satire, farce, black comedy and, ultimately, tragedy -- relates the efforts of J. and various other characters, his wife, civil service colleagues and superiors and others, to extricate himself from his predicament.

She lives in Oregon.This Halloween story, one of a series of Rotten Ralph books, continues the exploits of the truly terrible cat belonging to a little girl, Sarah, who has the patience of a saint. Dressed as each other, the pair go to a costume party where everyone is convinced that it is Sarah, not Ralph, who pours the goldfish into the punch bowl and takes the lid off the popcorn popper. Sarah is humiliated, but Ralph is delighted when their hostess asks Sarah (and that nice cat of hers) to leave. Though Ralph does almost nothing to redeem himself, Sarah forgives him, saying, "Oh, Ralph, you're still my best friend." Ralph's unpenitent devilry has great appeal for children, and this story's use of role reversal provides a thought-provoking twist. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cotton Fields No More: Southern Agriculture 1865 - 1980</h2><p>No general history of southern farming since the end of slavery has been published until now. For the first time, Gilbert C. Fite has drawn together the many threads that make up commercial agricultural development in the eleven states of the old Confederacy, to explain why agricultural change was so slow in the South, and then to show how the agents of change worked after 1933 to destroy the old and produce a new agriculture.<br><br>Fite traces the decline and departure of King Cotton as the hard taskmaster of the region, and the replacement of cotton by a somewhat more democratically rewarding group of farm products: poultry, cattle, swine; soybeans; citrus and other fruits; vegetables; rice; dairy products; and forest products. He shows how such crop changes were related to other developments, such as the rise of a capital base in the South, mainly after World War II; technological innovation in farming equipment; and urbanization and regional population shifts.<br><br>Based largely upon primary sources, <i>Cotton Fields No More</i> will become the standard work on post-Civil War agriculture in the South.

The greatest racing pigeon in history, worth over half a million dollars, vanished into thin air. If he&#39;s alive out there, his captors aren&#39;t talking. From the hidden but high-stakes world of pigeon racing comes the inside story of what really happened to &#34;The Black Deuce&#34;, Belgium&#39;s legendary winner of Europe&#39;s greatest race, Barcelona. In the 1990&#39;s, flying faster than 47,000 pedigreed homing pigeons, he won this 600+ mile event twice, a feat never before equaled. Adding tenfold to his value, his proven ability to sire champions. Then, tragedy. Imported to California, he was frightened from his new home. More than 5,000 miles from Belgium, returning there was suicide. But he tried, only to be ripped from the sky by a pair of deadly falcons. Lost, alone and only minutes from death, fate brought a young boy in Tacoma, Washington into his life. Jim Jenner&#39;s fascinating and heartwarming story reveals how &#34;The Black Deuce&#34;, a bird worth twenty times his weight in gold, fell into the lives of inner-city children with no idea of his value. But, more than money, his true worth lay in the transformative effect pigeons often have on their human keepers. This ancient, and life-changing transformation forms a bond they call &#34;The Featherhood&#34;. Writer/Director Jim Jenner has created more than a dozen award-winning films on pigeons and pigeon racing. Now he combines his vast knowledge of pigeons and the racing sport in a thrilling story of inner-city kids who stumble on a lost bird of enormous value. Filled with fascinating pigeon information and a cast of lovable and terrifying characters, this novel is a wonderful introduction to the pigeon hobby for young adults and older readers.</p><p></p><h2>Ransomed Bride (Brides of Montclair, Book 2)</h2><p><p>"I won't lose you now!" said Cam in a voice ragged with emotion. The moon moved across the sky from behind the sheltering trees, and suddenly the two of them were enveloped in moonlight. "I love you, and yet I know I have no right to speak to you of this.

And every individual part has been growing harmoniously, magnificently, ever since God the artist created it."</em><br> - Antoni Gaud�<br> <br> Wherever they go, anyone who visits Barcelona today will come across the works of Spanish architect Antoni Gaud� (1852-1926), the architect who has attracted art-lovers from all over the world to Spain. It was there, in the capital of Catalonia, that the famous master of architecture produced nearly all of his works.&nbsp;Raised during the Industrial Revolution, Gaud� strove to distinguish and reaffirm the identity of his native Catalonia as Spain and the rest of Europe modernized. Early neo-Gothic designs were the stepping-stone to the mature, original style that came to be synonymous with his name. Incorporating bold colors and odd bits of material into his designs, Gaud� created inspiring, visionary buildings and helped establish Barcelona (most notably with the still-unfinished Sagrada Fam�lia cathedral) as a city of the world. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Architecture Series features:<ul> <li>an introduction to the life and work of the architect</li> <li>the major works in chronological order</li> <li>information about the clients, architectural preconditions as well as construction problems and resolutions</li> <li>a list of all the selected works and a map indicating the locations of the best and most famous buildings</li> <li>approximately 120 illustrations (photographs, sketches, drafts and plans)</li> </ul></p><p>Compact Overviews of the World's Greatest Architects- TASCHEN's Basic Architecture Series <p>Basic Architecture features: <br>� Each title contains approximately 120 images, including photographs, sketches, drawings, and floor plans <br>� Introductory essays explore the architect&#x2019;s life and work, touching on family and background as well as collaborations with other architects <br>� The body presents the most important works in chronological order, with descriptions of client and/or architect wishes, construction problems (why some projects were never executed), and resolutions <br>� The appendix includes a list of complete works, biography, bibliography and a map indicating the locations of the architect&#x2019;s most famous buildings</p>Maria Antonietta Crippa is currently professor &#34;straordinario&#34; of History of Architecture at the Politecnico University in Milan, at the DiAP (Department of Architecture and Planning of the School of Architecture).

He ruled over all the land like a <br>great father, dispensing wisdom and putting down <br>rebellions. Ra was the creator, the first god of the <br>people of Khent, which today we call Egypt. Before <br>there were any others there was Ra, the all-seeing eye <br>in the unremitting hot sky over a parched desert <br>land. He was the First, just as the Aries Sun is the <br>first, and always will be. In his legend we see the sun <br>with early eyes, those of people who first looked up <br>and saw divinity, the source of life. Aries is primal <br>instinct, survival, and he is very good at it. <br> <br>Ra, as the sun, spent half the day soaring in the <br>air, inspecting his kingdom below. In the morning he <br>and his boat rose out of a lotus flower, and at night <br>he sank into the depths of the underworld, bringing <br>light for its dead inhabitants. This daily voyage was <br>not without peril, however; there was a great serpent, <br>Apep, living in the Nile, who sought to swallow <br>Ra's boat and had to be constantly fought off. <br> <br>In the underworld there were other terrors, each <br>attempting to devour his light. In some allegories, he <br>is born as a little child each morning and ages to an <br>old man each night. <br> <br>We tend to think of Aries as a simple, straightforward sign, <br>rather one-dimensional, without much depth. Nothing, however, <br>could be further from the truth. For one thing, Aries combines <br>apparently contradictory archetypes within him: the Innocent Child <br>of springtime and the Warrior of Mars. We will come to the Warrior <br>in a moment, but first we should look at Ra the sun god who lives <br>each day as if it were his whole life, present in the moment. This is <br>one of the gifts of Aries consciousness, especially in the solar placement. <br>Ra also needs to fight daily battles in order to survive and <br>bring light to both worlds, and here we can view the quintessentially <br>Arian trait of courage. This is the energy of the daily battle <br>that one emerges from victorious every time, and awakes fresh to <br>every morning, all demons defeated for the time being. It is part of <br>the Aries fire, and it is sustained by innocence. He does not believe <br>that he can lose or that each day may not be an event to be lived <br>with wonder. <br> <br>Ra had a secret box locked away, which was the source of his <br>power. In it, as his unfortunate grandson once found, were two <br>items: a poisonous snake and a magical lock of blue hair. The snake <br>had a tendency to leap out and kill anything that opened the box, <br>and the lock of hair could heal any wound, even that of the deadly <br>snake. The two together can be read as both the Achilles heel of <br>Aries-the anger that leaps out impulsively, not caring who its random <br>targets might be-and its salvation, the lock of hair as blue as <br>the wide sky. The sky, in Egyptian mythology, is the place of the crying <br>hawk, Ra's symbol, and Horus's as well. The flying bird looks <br>down on things from a distance, a quality the tempestuous Aries <br>Sun needs to learn-using his head (from whence comes the lock of <br>hair) rather than his leap-and-strike survival instinct. <br> <br>However, Ra made a few errors. Among them was his rather <br>strange attitude toward children and grandchildren. He drew from <br>himself the first two children, Shu the god of the air and Tefnut the <br>goddess of the dew, as if they were a mere experiment. When they <br>proceeded to have opinions and desires that did not mirror his, he <br>was rather surprised and annoyed. Shu and Tefnut mated and produced <br>two more children, Geb and Nut, and this upset Ra so much <br>that he ordered them permanently separated from each other, a task <br>Shu performed. When they managed to thwart him and produce <br>five children, however, he gave in and grudgingly accepted his new <br>brood. Aries likes new things, but only new things that go along <br>with his idea of how things should be, which seems like an impossible <br>contradiction and in fact is one. In spite of this, he recovers <br>quicker than many signs and does not hold grudges. <br> <br>When Ra grew old and weak, his subjects began to mutter <br>against him. This is the worst fear of Aries the Child, who hates the <br>idea of old age and lack of control. Ra decided to teach his rebellious <br>subjects a lesson and sent Sekhmet after them, but she ate so <br>many of them that he had to resort to getting her drunk in order to <br>stop the extinction of his entire kingdom. This shows that even <br>when Aries' anger seems like a good idea at the time, it often gets <br>out of hand and has repercussions that the enthusiastic Aries never <br>seems to guess at beforehand. Isis also took advantage of his old <br>age, playing the feminine Venus-ruled Libra Moon to his masculine <br>Mars-ruled Aries Sun and charming the words of power out of him. <br>Once she had them in hand, she nullified his power and took it for <br>herself, and he realized-as trusting Aries often does-that he had <br>just been had. <br> <br>Ra was the first god, and he was chief of the pantheon for millennia <br>of Egyptian history, but somewhere in the twelfth Pharaonic <br>dynasty a new god arose who would eclipse Ra and all the others, <br>up until the Christian era. He was warlike and strong, and bore as <br>patron animals the Arian ram and the aggressive goose. His name <br>was Amon, and his priesthood gained ground with disconcerting <br>speed. Pharaoh after pharaoh named himself after some relationship <br>to Amon or built temples or obelisks to him. The most famous of <br>them, the pharaoh who conquered more land than any other, was <br>named Ramses. Amon was Mars to the hilt; he was shown sometimes <br>as a man with double plumes on his head and sometimes as a <br>ram-headed man. He ruled the Age of Aries with his chariot and <br>lance. <br> <br>Seeing this, the priesthood of Ra agreed to combine the two gods, <br>and Amon-Ra came out of that agreement. The new composite <br>deity that was Amon-Ra owned so much of Egypt's wealth that his <br>priesthood was richer than the pharaoh. After the last of the Ramses <br>dynasty died off, the chief priest of Amon-Ra ascended the <br>throne himself. In Ethiopia his priesthood chose the rulers; in Libya <br>they built him a great shrine. Child, Old Man, Great Warrior-he <br>held within himself all the archetypes of Aries, all of which any <br>Aries Sun can access and manifest, and neither he nor any of his <br>worshippers saw any contradiction. <br> <br>Aries conquers less out of ambition than out of challenge-not of <br>others, but of himself. On some level, he knows that each trial will <br>improve his spirit a little more, and he is driven toward them. If he <br>can't find a worthy challenge to keep improving himself with, he <br>will find an unworthy one and pursue it anyway. He is the "I" <br>opposed to the Libran "Thou," and he can be self-centered, like Ra, <br>the sun that is the brightest thing in the sky. He can also fight to the <br>death for the right things, or the wrong ones. Aries' energy is not a <br>guided missile; it's a cannon that needs to be aimed properly or others <br>will suffer. Aimed at obstacles, he plows through them as if they <br>don't exist. It isn't so much ambition as the thrill of the chase. After <br>all, there are many reasons why a king or general would conquer <br>other lands, but Ramses, the chosen of Amon-Ra, did it for one reason <br>alone: glory. Aries understands glory. It's part of the secret of his <br>contradiction, you see . . . both the Child and the Warrior are surrounded <br>by clouds of glory. Different kinds, perhaps, but glory nonetheless. <br> <br>Glory is the heart of this most fiery of fire signs . . . and <br>after all this time, hawks still circle the glorious, blazing Sun. <br> <br>Gaea <br> <br><i>Sun in Taurus <br></i>The Earth is the place from whence all our bodies come. It can be <br>thought of as the original body that we grow out of and that we will <br>return to. It can even be thought of as the body that we are parasites <br>living in, if you'd like to put it that way. However we put it, it <br>comes down to the same thing: Earth and body are on some level <br>one and the same. There is the fiery core of chemical reaction, there <br>is the skin, and there is the place where Earth touches Sun. This surface <br>is the place where most of the life is concentrated, green and <br>growing, sessile and moving, constantly changing yet dancing in the <br>same old patterns of birth and death and rebirth from the soil. <br> <br>This interface of Earth and Sun is where we best experience the <br>sacred being that we call Gaea. Unlike other deities, she is easy to <br>see and touch. Other sacred beings can be experienced subtly in the <br>wind or the flames or the cycle of life, but Gaea is the most obvious <br>and tactile. We are never very far from her, unless we leave the <br>planet. She is right there, where we can dig in her, feed from her, <br>crumble her in our hands. And that's just the way Taurus likes it. <br> <br>The ancient Greeks named her Gaea. She has other names, <br>though-Tellus Mater, Erda, Artha, Hertha, and so forth. She is the <br>one constant in every religion, because we are all born of her. Yet to <br>reduce her simply to a personification of the ball of dirt we live on is <br>to far underestimate her in our psyches. She is Mother as much as <br>she is Earth, she is metaphorical as much as she is physical. In our <br>collective unconscious she is the nurturing figure who is more powerful <br>than our actual mothers, and to whom they never measure up. <br> <br>She is all-giving and maternal, but in a completely different way <br>than that of, say, Demeter, whom I have associated with Cancer. <br>Demeter loves personally and intensely, and is easily thrown off by <br>changes in her children, mirroring Cancer's sensitivity in the face of <br>trauma. Gaea mothers impersonally; she is all-generous, but none of <br>her children is more special to her than any other. She is hard to <br>shock. Like a secure Taurus individual, you can beat on her breast <br>and scream and she will stand patiently, loving but unmoved, until <br>you are done. <br> <br>If this immense archetype seems a little difficult to live up to, it is. <br>Yet every Taurean Sun has Gaea at the roots. Gaea's impersonal <br>force of gravity illustrates the Taurean Sun possessiveness, which is <br>strong but often seems impersonal. People sometimes become property- <br>like, thing-like, in their hearts, and thus the confusion when <br>their "things" get up and walk away. Although Taurus does have to <br>guard against this, it does not come out of a sociopathic need to <br>dehumanize or objectify; it is just the ripple of Gaea consciousness <br>coming through them. To her, we are all her things. <br> <br>At its worst, this can result in a kind of materialism where <br>objects or money take the place of attention or loving words. This <br>sort of Taurus is someone who, paradoxically, has not gotten away <br>from the earth archetype but has gone too deeply into it, and perhaps <br>needs to be dragged up and away by some other god who can <br>show them the long view. Whatever else material goods become a <br>replacement for, however, it will not be for physical affection. The <br>most sensual and affectionate of all the signs, Tauruses need physical <br>touch like they need water. It would do them well to remember <br>that earth without water-Taurus without Venus's ruling power of <br>love-is a desert. Sometimes just increasing the amount of loving <br>touch they have in their lives, assuaging that skin hunger, is enough <br>to bring them back from a dry world of materialism and drudgery. <br>For Taurus, hugs and cuddles really can work wonders. <br> <br>Like Gaea, who objected to Uranus the sky god spreading himself <br>over her and stifling her, Taureans may object to more airy types <br>who dominate the conversation, expect everything to move at their <br>pace, and become impatient at the Taurus need to make decisions <br>slowly and think things over carefully. Like the physical Gaea, Taurus <br>prefers slow changes to fast ones. The Earth does not live at the <br>same rate that we do, and it is as if Taurean Suns are tapped into <br>that Gaian clock just enough to keep them slowed down a little <br>more than the rest of us. Slow, of course, does not imply stupid. It is <br>not the opposite of intelligent, but rather the opposite of impulsive, <br>or rapid, or abrupt, or haphazard. Taurus would rather see that <br>something is well thought through than go off half-cocked. And on <br>a simple emotional level, it takes her longer to get used to things. <br>That's why it's hard for her to let go of people and jobs and ideas- <br>she'll have to get used to not having them around. <br> <br>It seems that in most descriptions of Taurus, astrologers go to the <br>trouble of emphasizing the bull rather than the cow, as if Taurus <br>was the most masculine of signs. It's actually ruled by Venus, the <br>most feminine planet of all, and is a supposedly "feminine" (meaning <br>receptive rather than aggressive) sign. So why all the macho posturing? <br>Perhaps in order not to offend male Taureans, who sometimes <br>do a good deal of macho posturing themselves, as if to prove <br>that they don't have any of those receptive qualities. Still, any sexism <br>out of Taurean men is far less about Taurus-type beliefs about <br>gender and far more about simply being socially conservative and <br>uncomfortable with major world-view changes. If we lived in a <br>matriarchy, Taurus men would probably be telling the rest of the <br>boys not to act uppity or take on women's airs. <br> <br>To change the mind of a Taurus, you have to be in their life, day <br>after day, putting forth your best effort to be friendly, not getting <br>into a lot of intellectual discussions (because even if you win them, <br>it probably won't change her mind) and just putting in the time <br>until she gets used to you and whatever your alternative ideas and <br>lifestyle are about. You'll have to outwait her, which will not be <br>easy. When you've become a fixture in her life, strange ideas and all, <br>she'll accept you because it will be more effort for her to throw you <br>out. You can even keep your strange ideas, because she's used to <br>them now (on you, anyway), and she'll be more shocked if you ever <br>change your mind. <br> <br>But anyway, back to the bull. This livestock animal appears in <br>hundreds of myths, from Europe to China, as the sacred earthspirit. <br>It seems (in the western half of the world, anyway) that if the <br>Earth Goddess could appear as an animal, it would be a cow, and so <br>the bull simply became Gaea's male incarnation. You will notice, <br>however, that the bull is often sacrificed to Gaea. Part of this is the <br>concept of giving back like to like, but the deeper meaning seems to <br>be that the aggressive, trampling nature of Taurus needs eventually <br>to be sacrificed to (read: cycle back into) the overarching archetype <br>of Gaea's abundance and generosity. <br> <br>Gaea gives abundantly because she has it to give, which describes <br>a Taurus Sun who is secure in themselves. They are also associated <br>with the archetype of the Builder, which they share with Capricorn <br>and occasionally Virgo. However, the motivations are different: it is <br>said that Taurus builds up because there are mountains, and levels <br>flat because there are fields, and digs deep because there are caves. <br>In other words, Taurus builds like the Earth makes ...</p><h2>Wire to Wire - The Walter Merrick Story</h2><p>The authorized biography of the Dean of the Quarter Racehorse Men, written by the acclaimed equine historian who is well known to readers of the Western Horseman Legends series of books.

These ideas, illuminated by public symbols hidden in full view, have influenced and shaped the society we have today. Despite this ongoing record of inspiration, no illustrated guide book to the basic ideas of Masonic Symbology has even been published and the story remains mysterious&#x2014;until now.</p><p>This authoritative guide reveals how this symbology has been the backdrop to key historical events in the history of humanity from ancient times and how, in more recent times, inspired leaders have harnessed the symbols' power to bring about change in society. Renowned Freemasonry historian Dr. Robert Lomas takes you inside the Secret Order and shows you how Entered Apprentices first learn their craft, and how continual exposure to these mystical symbols can change the way you think. You'll explore the six mysterious Tracing Boards that are at the heart of every Masonic Grand Lodge, ending with the final, most mystical symbol, known as "the Centre." Let <i>The Secret Power of Masonic Symbols</i> be your personal guide and show you how these symbols have made their indelible mark on the past, and how they will continue to influence society in the future.</p></p><p><strong>Dr. Robert Lomas</strong> is the author of<em> Turning the Templar Key</em>, <em>Turning the Solomon Key</em>, and several other titles. A Freemason, he lectures at Bradford University in England.<p><b>Symbols Made Us Human</b></p><p>A symbol is a pictorial device that evokes a concept in its entirety. It bypasses the intellect and talks straight to the heart. Our intellect analyzes, but our heart synthesizes. So a symbol evokes understanding without needing to convey verbal information.</p><p>Around 120,000 years ago, a new species of primate appeared in Africa. Its scientific name is Homo sapiens, but we know this creature as the modern human. When this species appeared on the earth, there were already other similar but more widespread species of humanoid apes, such as the Neanderthals. Yet the Homo sapiens were different. They were different because they could tap into the mystic power of understanding that is inherent in symbols. Symbols have helped humans develop a unique form of consciousness that no other animal has.</p><p>All the races of humans are much more closely related than most of us realize. You might be even more surprised to know how closely we are related our primate cousins, the African apes. Our genes are about 98 percent identical to those of an ape, and we share large chunks of our DNA sequence with all other life forms on the earth, even bacteria.</p><p>All humans are descended from a single female that lived in Africa less than 200,000 years ago. She is popularly called &#x201c;Mitochondrial Eve.&#x201d;2 As geneticist Bryan Sykes puts it: &#x201c;&#x2018;Mitochondrial Eve&#x2019; ... lies at the root of all the maternal ancestries of every one of the six billion people in the world. We are all her direct maternal descendants.&#x201d;3 Our common maternal ancestor lived only a few thousand generations ago. And her earliest descendants drew the first symbols and tapped into their power.</p><p>In the following chapters, you will learn about the power of these symbols, the history of their interaction with humans, and how humans&#x2019; differential advantage came about because they evolved a type of brain that benefits from a direct relationship with the symbols. This symbiotic relationship began during our early evolutionary history and continues to influence our development in ways most of us are often unaware of.</p><p>There is, however, a secret group of specialists who have spent the last 500 years working with these symbols. They learned how symbols can advance the human condition by enabling us to share understanding. This group is the Freemasons, and their declared purpose is to study and understand symbols.</p><p>Ask any Freemason the question What is Freemasonry? and you will get this answer: a peculiar system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols. For 500 years, Freemasons have used a system of allegorical ritual and exposure to the mystic power of symbols to sensitize their members to the life-changing power these symbols have. Freemasons continue to experience the deep understanding that symbols can inspire and their power to change the way humans develop.</p><p>When humans were first exposed to symbols&#x2019; mystic power, they changed from brute animals into human beings in a way we still struggle to understand. James Shreeve, a well-known anthropologist, sums up the puzzle presented by this abrupt change:</p><p>&#x201c;Human beings&#x2014;modern humans, Homo sapiens&#x2014;are behaviorally far, far away from being &#x201c;just another animal.&#x201d; The mystery is where, how, and why this change took place. ... An &#x201c;all-important transition&#x201d; did occur, but it happened so close to the present moment that we are still reeling from it. ... Something happened that turned a passably precocious animal into a human being.&#x201d;</p><p>Anthropology records how and when this change happened but offers no explanation. It is my contention that humanity came into contact with a powerful force outside itself that has interacted with our collective mind ever since. This force is carried and communicated by symbols. In later chapters, we will discover that symbols are part of a great cosmic language that transmits deep understanding about the secrets of the universe.</p></p><h2>At Home in Italy: Under the Summer Sun</h2><p>Italy&#x2019;s sun-drenched landscape, rich history, and welcoming lifestyle attract visitors from all over the world. <i>At Home in Italy</i> showcases a sumptuous selection of the country&#x2019;s most beautiful houses, described in great detail by the Editor of AD Italia, Nicoletta del Buono, and captured by the lens of renowned architecture photographer Massimo Listri.<br><br>As del Buono&#x2019;s vibrant text makes clear, as varied as traditional Italian approaches to design are&#x2014;each unique to its region&#x2014;they are nevertheless easily identifiable as Italian.

Roosevelt. Mitgang&#39;s extensive use of newspaper quotes and legal transcripts helps paint vivid portraits of Walker, Roosevelt and the large cast of characters who played a part in Walker&#39;s fall from grace and Roosevelt&#39;s meteoric rise to four-term president.</p><p>In the latter half of the Jazz Age 1920s, New York City's flamboyant "Night Mayor," Jimmy Walker, was often more likely to be found checking out Manhattan's numerous speakeasies than at his office. His luck ran out in 1932, however, when an investigation into citywide corruption led by former state judge Samuel Seabury set its sights on City Hall, and the governor--fellow Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who also happened to be in the midst of his first presidential campaign--became personally involved in the proceedings. By the end of the year, Walker had resigned and FDR was on his way to the White House.<p> <i>Once upon a Time in New York</i> is a lively account of how Walker's downfall came to play such a crucial role in Roosevelt's ascendancy. Herbert Mitgang lays out the complexities of New York City politics, still at that time deeply influenced by Tammany Hall, with admirable clarity, and the facts are so intriguing that he doesn't have to embellish them to heighten the reader's interest. On the other hand, the book is overloaded with period-setting data points. While it's helpful to know that Walker was a Yankees fan, Mitgang probably didn't need to include the batting averages of eight-ninths of the team's starting lineup in 1927. (And, while the song "Little Tin Box" from the Broadway musical <i>Fiorello!</i> is, in fact, a very humorous rendition of the Seabury hearings, it wasn't written until nearly 30 years had passed.) Still, with such a great setting, and such colorful characters, it's hard to go too far wrong. <i>Once upon a Time in New York</i> ends up being as fun to read as it is substantial.</p>Herbert Mitgang covered national, international, and New York cultural subjects as editorial writer and correspondent for <i>The New York Times</i>.

Information on some of these cold cases is available online, where amateur detectives sometimes take a stab at solving cases.<br> <br>When Tempe gets a call from Hazel &#x201c;Lucky&#x201d; Strike, a web sleuth who believes she&#x2019;s successfully connected a body in Tempe&#x2019;s lab to a missing eighteen-year-old girl, Tempe writes it off as another false alarm. Still reeling from her mother&#x2019;s diagnosis and the shock of Andrew Ryan&#x2019;s potentially life-change proposal, Tempe has little patience for chasing false leads. But when the bones in the lab match the missing girl&#x2019;s medical records, Tempe re-opens the case, returning to the spot where her remains were originally found.<br> <br>What seems at first to be an isolated tragedy takes on a more sinister cast as Tempe uncovers two more sets of bones nearby. Even more troubling is that the area is known as a viewing point for a famous unexplained light phenomenon, and that a local cult nearby has significant interest in the site. Tempe&#x2019;s suspicions turn to murder by ritual sacrifice&#x2014;a theory that gains even more urgency when Hazel herself turns up dead. Struggling to follow the tracks of a killer who will do anything not to be discovered, Tempe races to solve the murders and unravel the mysteries surrounding the site before the body count climbs higher.<br> <br>A suspenseful, modern addition to Temperance Brennan&#x2019;s ongoing story, <i>Speaking in Bones </i>proves that Kathy&#x2019;s pulse-pounding Bones series shows no signs of slowing down.</p><p>Kathy Reichs&#x2019;s first novel <i>D�j� Dead</i> was a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller and won the 1997 Ellis Award for Best First Novel. <i>A Conspiracy of Bones</i> is Kathy&#x2019;s nineteenth entry in her series featuring forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan.

My ribs are bruised and there&#x2019;s a lump behind my ear. I don&#x2019;t remember hitting my head. I&#x2019;m lying very still because my whole body aches. Like I&#x2019;ve been in a wreck. Like the time I crashed my bike. Why doesn&#x2019;t my family save me? Is no one missing me? I have only my family. No friends. It was just too hard. I&#x2019;m all alone. So alone. How long have I been here? Where is here? The whole world is slipping away. Everything. Everyone. Am I awake or asleep? Am I dreaming or is this real? Is it day or night?<br> <br>&#x201c;When they return they will hurt me again. Why? Why is this happening to me? I can&#x2019;t hear a sound. No. That&#x2019;s not true. I can hear my heart beating. Blood working inside my ears. I taste something bitter. Probably vomit stuck in my teeth. I smell cement. My own sweat. My dirty hair. I hate when my hair isn&#x2019;t washed. I&#x2019;m gonna open my eyes now. Got one. The other&#x2019;s crusted shut. Can&#x2019;t see much. It&#x2019;s all blurry, like I&#x2019;m looking up from way down underwater.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hate the waiting. That&#x2019;s when the pictures take over my brain. Not sure if they&#x2019;re memories or hallucinations. I see him. Always in black, his face crazy red and beaded with sweat. I avoid his eyes. Keep looking at his shoes. Shiny shoes. The candle flame&#x2019;s a little yellow worm dancing on the leather. He stands over me, all big and nasty. Thrusts his horrid, smelly face close to mine. I feel his icky breath on my skin. He gets mad and yanks me by the hair. His veins go all bulgy. He screams and his words sound like they&#x2019;re coming from another planet. Or like I&#x2019;ve left my body and I&#x2019;m listening from far away. I see his hand coming at me, clutching the thing so tight it quivers. I know I&#x2019;m shaking but I&#x2019;m numb. Or am I dead?<br> <br>&#x201c;No! Not now! Don&#x2019;t let it happen now!<br> <br>&#x201c;My hands are going all cold and tingly. I shouldn&#x2019;t be talking about him. I shouldn&#x2019;t have said he was horrid.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. They&#x2019;re coming.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why is this happening to me? What did I do? I&#x2019;ve always tried to be good.

He had almost everything he needed. There was just one thing he didn&#39;t have: a friend. The keepers give him Beauty, a little cat who does everything with him. The text is heartwarming celebration of an unlikely friendship.</p><p>Anthony Browne, a Hans Christian Andersen Medalist, is the author-illustrator of many acclaimed books for children, including SILLY BILLY. He lives in Kent, England.Starred Review. PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2014;This reworking of the classic tale of a beast transformed by unconditional love depicts the protagonist as a lumbering gorilla and Beauty as a petite cat. A red rose on the title page hints at what's to come. But wait! Alert readers will recognize this relationship, these very poses: here are Hanabi-Ko and All Ball from the real-life story of the sensitive, signing gorilla described by Francine Patterson in <i>Koko's Kitten</i> (Scholastic, 1985). Browne melds fact and fiction into a story that reads simply, but offers layers. Luscious, creamy pages provide contrast for the large, well-spaced font and the dark, furry figure that often bleeds off the page. Watercolor and pencil renderings capture the animal in moments of profound loneliness and extreme anger; he reacts to <i>King Kong</i> by smashing the TV in a page red with rage. Zookeepers fear for Beauty's safety, but her surprising intervention saves the day. Children will chuckle as they view the pair doing everything together, from using the bathroom to swinging from the lamp, like the mythical figure flying too close to the sun. (Bruegel's <i>Fall of Icarus</i> hangs in the background.) Browne's exquisite interpretation of a real-life gorilla is a welcome progression.&#x2014;<i>Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Almost always when we talk about prayer we refer to something we DO. But Burrows argues that our Christian knowledge assures us that prayer is essentially what God DOES. </p><p>And what God is doing for us is giving us the Divine Self in love. This is the vision of a contemplative nun who contradicts the heresy of so much modern spiritual writing. The growing fascination in the contemplative and monastic life is evidence of the profound appeal of this approach. </p><p>For this there is a real hunger. Ultimately, we live for God and not for ourselves.</p></p><p>Ruth Burrows is a Carmelite Nun from Quidenham in Norfolk, UK. She is the author of a number of bestselling books including <em>Guidelines for Mystical Prayer</em> and <em>Essence of Prayer</em>. Sister Wendy became a nun at the age of 16, went on to live for nearly 20 years as a hermit, and then was exposed to the world in a successful television career as the 'art nun'. She is the author of over 20 books with art as the main theme. She continues to live a cloistered life, devoted to prayer.'Ruth Burrows, the experienced Carmelite writer: hard-headed, warm-hearted, helpful and positive about God's universal invitation to prayer.'~ <em>The Tablet, </em>22nd July 2006 (Christopher Howse <i>The American Spectator</i>)<br><br>'This is a book that should chance lives. Its central message is that everyone can pray....Essence of Pray is a collection of short essays on prayer..Surprisingly, this structure works better than a book hammered out to a continuous shape, because there is a chance to avoid misunderstanding by coming at a subject from a difference angle.' ~ 16/09/2006 (Christopher Howse <i>The American Spectator</i>)<br><br>'It is useful as spiritual reading that will help the prayer and Christian lives of men and women living in the world.

(<i>The Daily Telegraph</i>)<br><br>'a genuine attempt to introduce the theory and practice of prayer to the uninitiated, in language that is accessible to all men and women.' <em>Mount Carmel</em>, July 2010<br><br>"The book has been written by one who clearly lives every word she writes. As Wendy Beckett says in her Foreword: 'to read Ruth Burrows...is to take into your mind and heart the insight of somebody who is close to God, and has the rare ability to share that closeness with others. God has given her great gifts, and she has opened herself to receive them' (p. vii). In this lies her appeal. Teresa of Avila wrote from her own experience. Ruth Burrows, too, writes from her own experience, albeit different from Teresa's. So she too writes with authority&#x2014;and it shows!

Kit must choose: either abandon Hannah, or stand by her and risk losing everything.<br> Boasting a stunning new cover and an introduction by Newbery Medalist Karen Cushman, this classic tale will capture the hearts and minds of today's readers.</p><p>Forced to leave her sunny Caribbean home for the bleak Connecticut Colony, Kit Tyler is filled with trepidation. As they sail up the river to Kit's new home, the teasing and moodiness of a young sailor named Nat doesn't help. Still, her unsinkable spirit soon bobs back up. What this spirited teenager doesn't count on, however, is how her aunt and uncle's stern Puritan community will view her. In the colonies of 1687, a girl who swims, wears silk and satin gowns, and talks back to her elders is not only headstrong, she is in grave danger of being regarded as a witch. When Kit befriends an old Quaker woman known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond, it is more than the ascetics can take: soon Kit is defending her life. Who can she count on as she confronts these angry and suspicious townspeople? <p> A thoroughly exciting and rewarding Newbery Medal winner and ALA Notable Children's Book, Elizabeth George Speare's <i>The Witch of Blackbird Pond</i> brings this frightening period of witch hysteria to life.

He spent three decades as a foreign correspondent for Time Magazine and other news organizations. David lives in Virginia, where he recently retired as a professor of history at Patrick Henry College.Set in 1998, this first novel by a senior correspondent for Time involves a reactionary but sometimes entertaining post-Cold War scenario. A second U.S. civil war pits the "Constitutionalists" against the "People's Movement" (PM), a left-wing coalition that seized power after Russia defeated the U.S. in Iran. National politics are topsy-turvy: Russia is a fascist state; the PM-run U.S. is communist, almost Maoist; while China has rejected Mao in favor of a market economy. The PC PM-ers are clearly the bad guys here and freedom under their rule is as precarious as it was under Stalin, though the PM has yet to master Stalin's efficiency in eliminating opposition. To that end they have enlisted the assistance of a Russian, Alexei Ilyich Ponomarev. Ponomarev in turn recruits supposed PM stalwart Douglas Richfield to infiltrate the Constitutionalists to discover both the identity of a Constitutionalist mole and to secure information about Project Almond, the opposition's nuclear trump card. It quickly becomes obvious which side Richfield will eventually support--especially since his love interest is active in the Constitutionalist underground. The rushed ending leaves unresolved a subplot about mutiny on a nuclear submarine and also leaves the reader feeling as though a chapter or two were missing. 50,000 first printing. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Patrick O&#x2019;Brian: A Very Private Life</h2><p><p><strong>An intimate portrait of the reclusive and brilliant author, written by his step-son Nikolai Tolstoy. </strong></p><p>The English novelist Patrick O&#x2019;Brian is much admired for his best-selling <em>Aubrey-Maturin</em> series of sea novels &#x2013; the unexpected success of the series secured his place in literary history.

Tolstoy also captures O&#x2019;Brian as he conducted research for the biography of his close friend and neighbour, Pablo Picasso.</p><p>Tolstoy maps his step-father&#x2019;s literary career, from its poverty-stricken beginnings to the remarkable success O&#x2019;Brian enjoyed later in life.

Gloria Whelan manages to take the fly-on-the-wall approach one step further in her latest piece of historical fiction. In <i>Angel on the Square</i>, a young girl joins Russian Tsar Nikolai II, Empress Alexandra, and their children when her mother becomes one of the empress's ladies-in-waiting. Katya Ivanova, as companion to the Romanov children, has an insider's view of the crumbling of tsarist Russia from 1913 to 1918. Initially, life is lavish and amusing for this young aristocrat, although her friend Misha's revolutionary ideas often battle in her mind with her own loyalty to the tsar. Gradually, though, the world outside begins to enter the palace walls, and Katya's life--along with that of all nobility--changes forever.<p> Whelan's balanced treatment of both sides of the Russian revolution is remarkably accessible. Katya is an appealing protagonist; readers will hang on her every word as she is transformed from a spoiled, sheltered child into a caring, hard-working adult. Young readers couldn't ask for a better introduction to this terrifying, earthshaking epoch in history.

But outside the palace, a terrible war is sweeping through Europe, and Russia is beginning to crumble under the weight of a growing revolution. Now, as Katya&#x2032;s once-certain future begins to dissolve, she must seek to understand what is happening to her beloved country and, for the first time in her life, take charge of her own destiny. </p><p> Ages 10+</p></p><h2>Mom, Are You There?</h2><p>With this gentle verse a mother helps a little girl plant a lilac bush to remember her by.

The minute hand on the hospital clock seemed to take forever to make it around the clockface. Finally the big hand hit eight o&#x2019;clock, and he congratulated himself for having made it through another hour. The almost imperceptible tick-tick-tick of the clock had become a constant companion, ticking away the seconds of his life.<br> <br>The nurse kept her eyes averted as she fussed with taking the lids off the various containers of his breakfast tray. He didn&#x2019;t blame her. There was a mirror on the underside of his bed tray. He had seen the damage. If he were her, he would keep his eyes averted, too.<br> <br>Evidently it had fallen on her to feed him today. She must have drawn the short straw.<br> <br>&#x201c;The weather?&#x201d; His voice was raspy. Inhaling the heat from the explosion had caused damage.<br> <br>The nurses had learned to have the answer ready to that question before they came through the door in the morning. The weather had become a small obsession with him. It reassured him that the outdoors still existed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cold and snowy,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;How cold?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;How snowy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe four or five inches fell overnight,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know the exact temperature, but it was so cold this morning, I had to wear my heaviest coat.&#x201d;<br> <br>From his room at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, he could see the sky&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but only the sky. There had been a heavy layer of nimbostratus clouds yesterday evening, and he had silently predicted that there would be anywhere from three to six inches of snow accumulation before morning. It gave him a small feeling of pride that he had predicted correctly. A man didn&#x2019;t spend as many hours in the air as he had without being able to read the clouds.<br> <br>&#x201c;We have some yummy peach yogurt today.&#x201d;<br> <br>The nurse was young. She had no idea how emasculating the word yummy sounded to him. He shoved his pride down as she tucked a napkin beneath his chin. He was forty-four years old. A captain in the U.S. Marines. A decorated war hero. He had been trained to withstand torture and avoid capture, and had the skills to escape if incarcerated. The one thing necessary to his survival that he had not been taught was how to keep his ego intact while being fed like a baby.<br> <br>His hands were still bandaged from instinctively shielding his face when the bomb detonated. His body was covered with multiple shrapnel wounds, and he&#x2019;d had reconstructive surgery on his left jaw and cheekbone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you want a sip of milk?&#x201d; The nurse opened a carton and inserted a straw into it.<br> <br>Actually, he would prefer a cup of hot, black coffee, but that was not an option. The chances of getting scalded by some clumsy nurse were too great, and he refused to sip his coffee through a straw. Instead, he swallowed the milk and waited for a spoonful of&#x2014;what was it she&#x2019;d said? Peach yogurt?<br> <br>Good grief.<br> <br>Eggs and bacon would have been his first choice. Fried crisp. The eggs scrambled in real butter. Half a loaf of homemade bread, toasted, with a pot of his mother&#x2019;s good strawberry jam. Now, that would be a breakfast, but until his throat healed, he was reduced to eating only those things that were easy to swallow.<br> <br>The nurse glanced over her shoulder at the silent television hanging on the wall. &#x201c;Do you want me to turn it on for you?&#x201d;<br> <br>He had been asked that question so many times.<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It would make time go faster.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shrugged and scraped the last bit of yogurt from the plastic container. &#x201c;Suit yourself.&#x201d;<br> <br>The television had been blaring when he first came to this room. At the time, his throat had not healed enough to tell them to turn it off. He had lain there, fighting against the most intense pain he had ever felt, wondering if he would live, wondering if he wanted to live, while being forced to listen to the canned laughter of some silly sitcom when nothing was funny.<br> <br>The first whispered, raspy words out of his mouth had been &#x201c;Turn that thing OFF!&#x201d;<br> <br>Post-traumatic stress disorder. That&#x2019;s what the hospital shrink called it. PTSD.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t buy it.<br> <br>In his opinion, PTSD was one of those catchphrase mental illnesses that the medical establishment used to pigeonhole and categorize people. Wrap up all the pain, shove it into a neat file folder, and tie it up with a bow.<br> <br>Oh, that guy? The one with all the bandages. The one sensitive to noise. He has PTSD. Classic symptoms. Understandable under the circumstances. Okay, next patient.<br> <br>He did not believe that he had PTSD. What he had was a perfectly reasonable desire for quiet. Raised voices, canned laughter, stupid commercials&#x2014;noise of any kind made his nerves fizz with anxiety and irritation.<br> <br>Now, at least, he could lie in blessed silence&#x2014;or as close to it as a hospital could get&#x2014;dozing in a drug-induced stupor after the morphine shots, enduring the minutes after it had worn off until the next shot was due.<br> <br>He did not complain. Marines did not complain, and even though he was battered and broken, what was left of him was still every inch a soldier.<br> <br>He was not a man who often prayed unless the helicopter he was flying was under fire. Then he would toss off a quick prayer during evasive maneuvers. More often than not, that prayer included a few curse words.<br> <br>Since the explosion, a set of very specific prayers began running through his head.<br> <br>If you&#x2019;ll pull me through this, Lord, I promise to go back home and make things right with my father and Claire. Please let me live. Please let me heal. Please let me walk out of here on my own two feet. Then a scrap of Scripture, vaguely recalled. Remember not the sins of my youth.</p><h2>Jesus in the Gospels: A Biblical Christology</h2><p>According to Rudolf Schnackenburg, a truly historical portrait of Jesus is unattainable because the primary sources written about Jesus were not historical records as such. What is attainable, however, is a faith interpretation of Jesus&#39; life and works, gleaned from the writings of those closest to the life of Christ: the four Gospels. Schnackenburg here provides a full faith interpretation of Jesus as each Gospel community portrayed him. Numerous commonalities about Jesus among these Gospels are revealed, and a fully recognizable portrait of Jesus emerges.</p><p>Rudolf Schnackenburg is Emeritus Professor of New Testament Exegesis at the University of Wurzburg in Germany.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>JFK: The Presidency of John F.

De Chirico made his career in Paris in the years before World War I, combining his nostalgia for ancient Mediterranean culture with his fascination for the curios found in Parisian shop windows. Beloved by the Surrealists, this uncanny image exemplifies de Chirico&#x2019;s radical &#x201c;metaphysical&#x201d; painting, which creates a disturbing sense of unreality, outside logical space and time, through the novel depiction of ordinary things.

He operates a boatbuilding shop in Tuckahoe, N.J. and has sailed more than 50,000 miles-six times across the Atlantic-in boats of his own design and construction. His work is regularly featured in Boatbuilder magazine and he is the author of several books, including Multihull Voyaging, also published by Sheridan House.I am not given to tantrums but what really provokes major wobblies are those unrequested emails, with umpteen high-res images attached which take forever to download. One such started coming in a while back and more in anger than in sorrow, I picked up this book. Mr. Jones so calmed me down that when the Mac pinged a whole hour later, I paused briefly to bin the email unopened and returned immediately to his book.<br><br>What is it, I wonder, which makes boat designers such good writers? On the face of it, a book which discusses the design and construction of a selections of simple small boats, daysailers, outboard runabouts, slender motorboats and simple multihulls may not seem like the stuff of real reading. Informative perhaps but like a computer mag, not something anyone would actually enjoy in a literary way? But Tom Jones combines the instruction with insights into why boats are shaped the way they are and with all kinds of anecdotes and digressions. The best part of the practical stuff is that six of the craft described come with building plans; the best part of the personal writing comes in an appreciation of Phil Bolger. One for the boatshop and beach. (<i>WaterCraft</i>)<br><br>Tom Jones is a professional boatbuilder, designer and writer he is also a highly experienced offshore sailor, as evidenced for example in his book Multihull Voyaging. He has, in fact, made six trans-Atlantics in boats of his own design. New Plywood Boats has chapters on Row and Paddle Boats, Daysailers, Runabouts, Long Narrow Powerboats and Sailing Multihulls, each chapter containing plans and construction details for a number of craft, not entirely (but mostly) built of plywood, ranging in size from a kayak to a thirty foot powerboat. There are lots of drawings and photographs, and entertaining anecdotes about boats and their owners. The US origins of the book are evident in the selection of designs (some being developments of traditional North American craft), and to some extent construction materials, but it is none the worse for that. There is a distinct similarity with some of Phil Bolger s work, and indeed the final chapter is an appreciation of Phil. New Plywood Boats is worthy of a place on the bookshelf (or in the workshop) of anyone seriously interested in building a plywood boat, and will be of interest to all of us who enjoy daydreaming about being on the water.

And when he&#39;s introduced to the seven-foot, granite-muscled figure of Everett Davis, champion wrestler and head of the burgeoning Global Wrestling Alliance, he knows he&#39;s found it. The GWA&#39;s televised tour of Europe has been dogged by inexplicable technical hitches and terrifying accidents in the ring - leaving Everett convinced that someone is trying to sabotage his business before it can take on the big boys and go global. Under the inspired disguise of Master of Ceremonies, Oz enters the extraordinary world of professional wrestling to try and unmask the perpetrator. But as he begins to discover the dangerous reality behind the glittering facade, a string of accidents becomes murder, and suddenly Oz has to wrestle with the biggest crisis of his life.</p><p>Quintin Jardine offers plenty of treachery and carnal intrigue in this first&#x2013;rate mystery series featuring private investigator Osbert &#x201c;Oz&#x201d; Blackstone and his alluring partner Primavera Phillips.Quintin Jardine was born once upon a time in the West - of Scotland rather than America, but still he grew to manhood as a massive Sergio Leone fan. On the way there he was educated, against his will, in Glasgow, where he ditched a token attempt to study law for more interesting careers in journalism, government propaganda, and political spin-doctoring. After a close call with the Brighton Bomb in 1984, he moved into the even riskier world of media relations consultancy, before realising that all along he had been training to become a crime writer.

Chapters focus on America&#39;s increasing dependence on petroleum; U.S.-Israeli relations; the rise of revolutionary nationalist movements in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, and Libya; the futility of U.S. military and covert intervention; and the unsuccessful attempt to broker a &#34;peace-for-land&#34; settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. A new epilogue addresses the recent U.S. war in Iraq. Little offers valuable historical context for anyone seeking a better understanding of the complicated relationship between the U.S. and the Middle East.</p><p>"Little provides literary flair, both in his references to fiction and in his own writing style. . . .

In 1912, he collaborated with the artist Burlyuk on the poem, &#34;A Slap in the Face of Public Taste,&#34; that was to become the manifesto of the young Futurist movement in Russia - a movement Trotsky was later to characterize as &#34;the presentment in art of the impending blast that was to discharge the social electricity accumulated in the air of the old pre-revolutionary society.&#34; By the time the Revolution came, Mayakovsky was already a mature poet. Many artists and writers sensed the inevitable approach of the Revolution, but no one was closer to it in spirit, no one welcomed it with more jubilant impatience, no one believed in it more dynamically than Mayakovsky. The impact of his vision and impassioned pleas for the protection of the revolutionary ideals was enormous. More than twenty-three million copies of his works have been sold in the fifty-one languages of the U.S.S.R. Today Mayakovsky is regarded throughout Russia as the most significant poet and playwright of the Revolution. The four plays in this volume - all in new and definitive translations - are prime materials for the understanding of Russia, its culture and its people.</p><p></p><h2>Counting Kisses: Lap Edition</h2><p>Karen Katz's bestselling board book, <b><i>Counting Kisses</i></b>, is now available as an oversized lap edition!</p><p>Karen Katz has written and illustrated more than fifty picture books and novelty books including the bestselling <i>Where Is Baby&#x2019;s Belly Button?</i> After graduating from the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia, she attended the Yale Graduate School of Art and Architecture where she became interested in folk art, Indian miniatures, Shaker art, and Mexican art.

A fussy baby receives "ten little kisses on teeny tiny toes/nine laughing kisses on busy, wriggly feet/eight squishy kisses on chubby, yummy knees," and so on down to "one last kiss on your sleepy, dreamy head." Each member of the family takes a turn bestowing kisses on the child: mom, dad, grandma, big sister, and even the dog and cat. Katz uses bold colors and lines to accent the flat, yet expressive illustrations. Heavy use of pink, combined with an array of brightly colored patterns, adds to the tender, happy tone of the story. Collage pieces are seamlessly woven into the gouache and colored-pencil illustrations, and Katz throws in some surprising perspectives, such as the mother kissing the baby's toes shown from the infant's point of view. The final spread, which shows the whole family smiling down at the sleeping child in her crib, epitomizes the loving warmth of this pitch-perfect bedtime story. Though somewhat reminiscent of Molly Bang's Ten, Nine, Eight (Greenwillow, 1983), this delightful book has a charm all its own and will surely become a standard at baby and toddler storytimes.-Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Carroll County Public Library, Eldersburg, MD</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>yolo (Internet Girls, The)</h2><p>Through texts and messages, the mega-bestselling, beloved Internet Girls series followed the ups and downs of school for three very different, very close friends.

They encounter many challenges&#x2014;failure, drunkenness, heartbreak, and successes&#x2014; and ultimately discover their true friends. Maddie embraces the California lifestyle and is assigned to a suite with three other girls referred to as the "Esbees" because they are from Santa Barbara. Maddie tries hard to find her niche within this group, but soon becomes aware of how challenging it is to be accepted into an already-established social circle. In the first few months of college, Maddie is almost unable to continue with the yolo (you only live once) mission especially when her parents can't afford to fly her home for Thanksgiving break. Angela enters college drawn to the Greek lifestyle of partying, fraternity socials and the appeal of belonging but sees that she may not agree with all of the initiation rituals and the unwritten rules. Through her association with the Zeta's, she finds herself in some questionable situations and one specifically alters the rest of her college choices. Zoe decides to attend a liberal college and try a long-distance relationship with her boyfriend, Doug but realizes that they have both moved on. After overcoming her depression, she also learns that she loves to run to release stress, and she experiments with her sexuality. Zoe faces failure in a creative writing class when a professor does not recommend her to keep moving through the program, but she is not discouraged. Told in Internet-age style of text messages and tweets first seen in Myracle's ttyl (Abrams, 2004), the girls try to embrace the free-spirited yolo philosopy as they grow into their young adulthood.&#x2014;Jessica Lorentz Smith, Bend Senior High School, OR</p><h2>Think &amp; Eat Yourself Smart</h2><p>softcover</p><p></p><h2>Cobweb Morning (Red Collector&#39;s Choice edition)</h2><p>Sister Alexandra met Doctor Taro, when he asked her to help with Penny, a teenager with amnesia.

With The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Agatha Christie's cerebral and eccentric Belgian detective steps out of retirement and into the limelight of a classic mystery.<p>Styles Court is a magnificent English manor house owned by a rich, strong-willed matron who, to the dismay of her stepson, has recently married a fortune hunter. The scene is set for death by violence. The murder of the mistress of Styles Court is so baffling, so cleverly-plotted, that it challenges even the skill of Hercule Poirot, notwithstanding the legions of tiny gray cells that take residence in his ever-so-fertile mind.</p>Who poisoned the wealthy Emily Inglethorpe, and how did the murderer penetrate and escape from her locked bedroom? Sus-pects abound in the quaint village of Styles St. Mary--from the heiress's fawning new husband to her two stepsons, her volatile housekeeper, and a pretty nurse who works in a hospital dispensary. Making his unforgettable debut, the brilliant Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is on the case. <br>"The key to the success of this style of detective novel," writes Elizabeth George in her Introduction, "lies in how the author deals with both the clues and the red herrings, and it has to be said that no one bettered Agatha Christie at this game."</p><h2>Smarter Than You Think: How Technology is Changing Our Minds for the Better</h2><p>It's undeniable&#x2014;technology is changing the way we think. But is it for the better? Amid a chorus of doomsayers, Clive Thompson delivers a resounding "yes." The Internet age has produced a radical new style of human intelligence, worthy of both celebration and analysis. We learn more and retain it longer, write and think with global audiences, and even gain an ESP-like awareness of the world around us. Modern technology is making us smarter, better connected, and often deeper&#x2014;both as individuals and as a society.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Smarter Than You Think </i>Thompson shows that every technological innovation&#x2014;from the written word to the printing press to the telegraph&#x2014;has provoked the very same anxieties that plague us today. We panic that life will never be the same, that our attentions are eroding, that culture is being trivialized. But as in the past, we adapt&#x2014;learning to use the new and retaining what&#x2019;s good of the old.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thompson introduces us to a cast of extraordinary characters who augment their minds in inventive ways. There's the seventy-six-year old millionaire who digitally records his every waking moment&#x2014;giving him instant recall of the events and ideas of his life, even going back decades. There's a group of courageous Chinese students who mounted an online movement that shut down a $1.6 billion toxic copper plant. There are experts and there are amateurs, including a global set of gamers who took a puzzle that had baffled HIV scientists for a decade&#x2014;and solved it collaboratively in only one month.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Smarter Than You Think </i>isn't just about pioneers. It's about everyday users of technology and how our digital tools&#x2014;from Google to Twitter to Facebook and smartphones&#x2014;are giving us new ways to learn, talk, and share our ideas. Thompson harnesses the latest discoveries in social science to explore how digital technology taps into our long-standing habits of mind&#x2014;pushing them in powerful new directions. Our thinking will continue to evolve as newer tools enter our lives. <i>Smarter Than You Think </i>embraces and extols this transformation, presenting an exciting vision of the present and the future.</p><p>Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the <i>New York Times</i> Magazine and <i>Wired</i>. He also writes for <i>Fast Company</i>, and appears regularly on many NPR programs, CNN, Fox News, and NY1, among others.<p>The &#x201c;extended mind&#x201d; theory of cognition argues that the reason humans are so intellectually dominant is that we&#x2019;ve always outsourced bits of cognition, using tools to scaffold our thinking into ever-more-rarefied realms. Printed books amplified our memory. Inexpensive paper and reliable pens made it possible to externalize our thoughts quickly. Studies show that our eyes zip around the page while performing long division on paper, using the handwritten digits as a form of prosthetic short-term memory. &#x201c;These resources enable us to pursue manipulations and juxtapositions of ideas and data that would quickly baffle the unaugmented brain,&#x201d; as Andy Clark, a philosopher of the extended mind, writes.</p><p>Granted, it can be unsettling to realize how much thinking already happens outside our skulls. Culturally, we revere the Rodin ideal&#x2014;the belief that genius breakthroughs come from our gray matter alone. The physicist Richard Feynman once got into an argument about this with the historian Charles Weiner. Feynman understood the extended mind; he knew that writing his equations and ideas on paper was crucial to his thought. But when Weiner looked over a pile of Feynman&#x2019;s notebooks, he called them a wonderful &#x201c;record of his day-to-day work.&#x201d; No, no, Feynman replied testily. They weren&#x2019;t a record of his thinking process. They were his thinking process:</p><p>&#x201c;I actually did the work on the paper,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Weiner said, &#x201c;the work was done in your head, but the record of it is still here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not a record, not really. It&#x2019;s working. You have to work on paper and this is the paper. Okay?&#x201d;</p><p>Every new tool shapes the way we think, as well as what we think about. The printed word helped make our thought linear and abstract and vastly increased our artificial memory. Newspapers shrank the world; then the telegraph shrank it even further, producing a practically teleportational shift in the world of information. With every innovation, cultural prophets bickered over whether we were facing a technological apocalypse or utopia. Depending on which Victorian-age pundit you asked, the telegraph was either going to usher in a connected era of world peace or drown us in idiotic trivia. Neither was quite right, of course, yet neither was quite wrong. The one thing that both apocalyptics and utopians understand is that every new technology invisibly pushes us toward new forms of behavior while nudging us away from older, familiar ones. Harold Innis&#x2014;the lesser known but arguably more interesting intellectual midwife of Marshall McLuhan&#x2014;called it the &#x201c;bias&#x201d; of a new tool.</p><p>What exactly are the biases of today&#x2019;s digital tools? There are many, but I&#x2019;d argue three large ones dominate. First, they&#x2019;re biased toward ridiculously huge feats of memory; smartphones, hard drives, cameras and sensors routinely record more information than any tool did before, and keep it easily accessible. Second, they&#x2019;re biased toward making it easier to find connections&#x2014;between ideas, pictures, people, bits of news&#x2014;that were previously invisible to us. And the third one is they encourage a superfluity of communication and publishing. This last feature has a lot of surprising effects that are often ill understood. Any economist can tell you that when you suddenly increase the availability of a resource, people not only do more things with it but they do increasingly odd and unpredictable things. As electricity became cheap and ubiquitous in the West, its role expanded from things you&#x2019;d expect&#x2014;like nighttime lighting&#x2014;to the unexpected and seemingly trivial: Battery-driven toy trains, electric blenders. The superfluity of communication today has produced everything from a rise in self-organized projects like Wikipedia to curious new forms of expression: Television-show recaps, video-game walk-throughs, map-based storytelling.</p><p>In one sense, these three shifts&#x2014;infinite memory, dot-connecting, explosive publishing&#x2014;are screamingly obvious to anyone who&#x2019;s ever used a computer. Yet they also somehow constantly surprise us by producing ever-new &#x201c;tools for thought&#x201d; (to use the writer Howard Rheingold&#x2019;s lovely phrase) that upend our daily mental habits in ways we never expected. Indeed, these phenomena have already woven themselves so deeply into the lives of people around the globe that it&#x2019;s difficult to stand back and take account of how much things have changed and why. While this book maps out what I call the future of thought, it&#x2019;s also frankly rooted in the present, because many parts of our future have already arrived, even if they are only dimly understood. As the sci-fi author William Gibson famously quipped: &#x201c;The future is already here&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just not very evenly distributed.&#x201d; This is an attempt to understand what&#x2019;s happening to us right now, the better to see where our augmented thought is headed. Rather than dwell in abstractions, like so many marketers and pundits&#x2014;not to mention the creators of technology, who are often remarkably poor at predicting how people will use their tools&#x2014;I focus more on the actual experiences of real people.</p></p><h2>Code Of Conduct (Scot Harvath: Thorndike Press Large Print Core)</h2><p>The award-winning author of such best-selling works as The Last Patriot and Blowback presents another thriller starring counterterrorism operative Scot Harvath.

Mist clung to the damp jungle road.<br> <br>Scot Harvath pulled out his phone and watched the video again. How many times had he seen it now? A hundred? Two hundred?<br> <br>It was shaky and parts were out of focus. A team in biohazard suits could be seen going into a small medical clinic. Moments later, there were muzzle flashes and gunfire. Then nothing.<br> <br>The footage had been emailed to CARE International, the U.S.-based charitable organization that had helped establish the clinic. The video quickly made its way to CARE&#x2019;s founder, businessman cum philanthropist, Ben Beaman.<br> <br>Over the next several hours, Beaman tried to contact the Matumaini Clinic in eastern Congo. No one replied. Finally, he hit the panic button and reached out to the most senior person he knew at the State Department. But with no Americans at the clinic at the time, there was little the State Department could do. It was &#x201c;outside their mission,&#x201d; as his contact informed him. The man offered to make some calls on his behalf, but told Beaman not to get his hopes up.<br> <br>Beaman saw CARE as a family. An attack on one of them was an attack on all of them. He made no distinction whether the person was from Kinshasa or Kansas City. If the State Department wouldn&#x2019;t help, he&#x2019;d have to look elsewhere.<br> <br>But where? Even if he knew someone there, the FBI and CIA were just as likely to say no.

Now, though, they were finding themselves repeatedly tasked on covert operations by the White House and the Central Intelligence Agency.<br> <br>There had been a rough patch when the Carlton Group had no choice but to take anything that came their way, but that was in the past. They seldom took private assignments anymore. When they did, there had to be a compelling reason.<br> <br>Similar to Doctors Without Borders, CARE went where few dared and even fewer wanted to go. From Mumbai to Mogadishu, they had set up shop in some of the worst poverty-stricken backwaters of the third world.<br> <br>While there, CARE&#x2019;s western volunteers not only treated locals but helped local medical personnel improve their skills. They were good �people who did good things for those in desperate need. The organization was also one that was no stranger to violence.<br> <br>Over the years, their facilities and personnel had experienced a handful of attacks. They took security seriously, but there was only so much they could afford to do. They wanted to use as much of their money as possible helping people. That was their mission.<br> <br>They had been planning to open two more clinics in Congo, but Beaman had put a temporary stop to those. Until they knew what had �happened at the Matumaini Clinic, they weren&#x2019;t moving on anything.<br> <br>While the U.S. Government didn&#x2019;t like to use NGOs for covert operations, the Carlton Group&#x2019;s founder had a different view. He had a couple of relationships already, but nothing like CARE. Getting them into his back pocket could be invaluable.<br> <br>Even better, Beaman had offered to pay the Carlton Group a significant premium. It was a dangerous assignment and Beaman appreciated the risks. He only had one stipulation. He wanted Scot Harvath leading the operation.<br> <br>Right out of the gate, they had a problem. Technically, Harvath wasn&#x2019;t available.<br> <br>He had been working at a furious tempo and had just come off of a hellacious operation in Syria. Everything at home had been put on hold, and that included his relationship.<br> <br>She lived in Boston and Harvath lived outside D.C., near Alexandria. The distance made things difficult enough. What was making it almost impossible, though, was how many times Harvath had rescheduled with her or had left the country entirely without giving her any notice at all. She had asked him to put one week on the books, then set it in stone, wrap it in bulletproof Kevlar, and bury it under fifty feet of concrete.<br> <br>Harvath picked one, went to Carlton, and had him sprinkle holy water on the dates. The deal was done.<br> <br>They would take in New England&#x2019;s fall colors. She pulled strings at work to have the same week off. She rented the perfect cottage on the water and convinced the Realtor to take delivery of two cases of their favorite wine. It would be a great surprise.<br> <br>They would stop at her favorite general store on the way and stock up on supplies. Once they arrived at the cottage, the wine would be there and they wouldn&#x2019;t have to leave for anything. The master bedroom had enormous windows and they could watch the colors peak from there. It was exactly what they needed.<br> <br>When Reed Carlton, or the &#x201c;Old Man&#x201d; as Harvath referred to him, called, he got right to the point. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a meeting in the office tomorrow morning. Be here by seven-thirty. Wear a suit.&#x201d;<br> <br>Obviously, somebody important was coming in, but Carlton hadn&#x2019;t offered up any details. Typical. The old spymaster never revealed more than he wanted anyone to know.<br> <br>Harvath didn&#x2019;t mind. He was used to it by now. He was also already half checked out, looking forward to a week away up in New England.<br> <br>The next morning, the five-foot-ten Harvath showed up at the Carlton Group&#x2019;s offices in Reston, Virginia, coffee in hand, wearing a coal gray Ralph Lauren suit, white shirt, and a dark blue tie. With only cardio for his workouts overseas, he had dropped about ten pounds from his already fit frame.<br> <br>His blue eyes stood out against his tan skin, and his sandy brown hair appeared lighter. In the mirror that morning, he had looked more like a beach-going Southern California college student, than a U.S. Navy SEAL turned covert counterterrorism operative.<br> <br>The Old Man was already in the conference room with their guest. Harvath stepped in and was introduced to Ben Beaman, the Director of CARE International.<br> <br>After Harvath asked how the doctor he had rescued in Afghanistan was doing, Carlton invited everyone to take their seats and then steered the conversation to the matter at hand.<br> <br>Beaman had brought his laptop and ran both men through a quick Power�Point about the Matumaini Clinic. The slides included pictures of the facility, its staff, and the people they served, mostly families with children.<br> <br>The clinic&#x2019;s name came from the Swahili word for hope. It was deep in the jungle near the border with Uganda&#x2014;the only medical facility for over two hundred kilometers. It boasted fifteen beds, an exam room that doubled as a laboratory, and a small dispensary.<br> <br>Beaman&#x2019;s final slide contained the video of the attack. He pushed the play button and the three men watched.<br> <br>When it was over, Beaman closed his laptop and sat back in his chair. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all we know,&#x201d; he had said.<br> <br>The Old Man activated a flat screen beyond the conference table. On it, he explained, was recent satellite footage he had acquired.<br> <br>When he clicked a small wireless device, the image was magnified, coming to rest on a small clearing that had been hacked out of the dense jungle. In the center was Beaman&#x2019;s clinic.<br> <br>There was no sign of anyone anywhere near it.<br> <br>Carlton held up his index finger as if to say, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something else,&#x201d; and then drew their attention back to the screen.<br> <br>Manipulating the wireless device, he refocused the image, northwest of the clinic. There, they could see what looked like a long, scorched trench at the base of a hill. Tendrils of black smoke curled into the air from it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Any idea what that is?&#x201d; the Old Man asked.<br> <br>Beaman shook his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Looks like a burn pit,&#x201d; Harvath replied. &#x201c;A big one.&#x201d;<br> <br>Carlton nodded. &#x201c;I agree. Any thoughts on what they were burning?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it was trash.&#x201d;<br> <br>Beaman looked from one man to the other, and the volume of his voice dropped. &#x201c;Do you think they were burning bodies?&#x201d;<br> <br>The Old Man switched off the satellite footage. &#x201c;It could be anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But what if it is bodies?&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;What if those are women and children? Our staff and patients?&#x201d; He shifted his gaze to Harvath and asked, &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s not trash, what is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>Harvath had been to more war-ravaged areas than he cared to remember. He had seen things beyond horrible. The worth of a culture, in his opinion, could be boiled down to one thing&#x2014;how well that culture took care of its weakest members, particularly its women and children.<br> <br>The satellite image of the burn pit brought back a flood of memories, none of them pleasant, none of them things he wanted to remember. Something about it, though, was odd. He tried to put his finger on it and when he couldn&#x2019;t, he relegated it to the back of his mind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Carlton is right,&#x201d; Harvath conceded. &#x201c;It could be anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>For a moment, Beaman didn&#x2019;t know how to respond. &#x201c;But we all agree, it probably wasn&#x2019;t trash.&#x201d;<br> <br>Harvath looked to the Old Man, then back at Beaman, and nodded.<br> <br>An uncomfortable silence fell over the conference room. Finally, Beaman broke it. &#x201c;Mr. Harvath, I want to find out what happened. Scratch that,&#x201d; he said, correcting himself. &#x201c;I have to find out what happened. I owe it to those people, to all of my people. If this had happened to a team you were responsible for, I don&#x2019;t doubt that you&#x2019;d feel the same way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Harvath began to understand where this was headed. Beaman wanted him to lead the operation.<br> <br>If their places were reversed, of course Harvath would want to know what had happened to his team. But this wasn&#x2019;t about a team of his. This was about Beaman&#x2019;s people, and there was a lot more to this story. It wasn&#x2019;t as simple as flying over and figuring out what had happened.<br> <br>Congo was the world&#x2019;s deadliest conflict zone. Five and a half million dead in less than twenty years. Invasions from neighboring countries, wars, political instability&#x2014;it was like a match factory, if match factories also stored buckets of gasoline and hung lit sparklers from the ceiling. Calling it unstable was too generous by half.<br> <br>The danger and instability of the region were just two of the many problems Harvath saw with this situation. There was also a host of un�answered questions. No one even knew who had sent the video to CARE and worse still, no one could explain why the gunmen entering the clinic had been wearing biohazard suits.<br> <br>According to Beaman, Matumaini was a small family medicine clinic. They didn&#x2019;t treat highly communicable illnesses. They didn&#x2019;t have the capacity. The furthest they went was performing minor surgeries. If something exotic or unusual walked in their door, they knew to call for help.<br> <br>But as far as Beaman, or anyone at CARE knew, no such call had gone&nbsp;out.<br> <br>Harvath didn&#x2019;t like it any of it. He hated loose ends. There were too many things stacked one upon another that didn&#x2019;t make sense.<br> <br>Beaman was also running out of time. The longer it took to get a team over to Congo, the colder the trail would become. If something wasn&#x2019;t done soon, they might never know what happened and who was responsible.<br> <br>Once again, a rush of unpleasant images moved across the screen of his mind&#x2019;s eye. The scenes of families were the hardest to stomach. He had witnessed what monsters could do. He knew what monsters continued to do when not stopped. In this case, the monsters embodied an amplified evil. They had preyed not only on the sick and infirm, but also upon those who had helped to care for them.<br> <br>His mind then drifted to his trip to New England, but only as an afterthought. He had already decided what he was going to do. What he told himself he had to do. The Carlton Group didn&#x2019;t have anyone else who could take on this kind of assignment with so little advance warning.<br> <br>If he didn&#x2019;t agree to take charge, it wouldn&#x2019;t get done. The State �Department had passed, and Beaman was right, the FBI and CIA weren&#x2019;t going to help him either. Harvath was CARE&#x2019;s only hope.<br> <br>It would be an absolute ballbuster of an assignment, and he would have to figure out a lot of it on the fly, but he knew he could do it. Just like he knew he could convince Lara that he had no choice but to postpone their trip to New England. He would find leaves for her someplace else, someplace even better. It would all work out.<br> <br>And with his decision made, he had jumped in with both feet. Logistics, equipment, funds, support . . . it was chaos, but he relished the challenge because chaos was the arena in which he excelled. The Old Man had left him with one final directive. &#x201c;Get in and get the hell out as fast as you can.&#x201d;<br> <br>Within twenty-four hours, he was on the ground in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Twelve hours later, he had assembled his team and they were on their way north to the Matumaini Clinic.<br> <br>Exiting out of the video player, he took another look at his text message screen before returning the phone to his pocket and powering down the tiny Iridium cube he used to access the satellite network. He had texted Lara when he had touched down to let her know that he had arrived safely. She had not responded and Harvath tried to put it out of his mind. He needed to get his head in the game.<br> <br>If everything went according to plan, they would be in and out. At least that&#x2019;s what he had told himself. He had also told himself that he&#x2019;d be able to sway Lara about cancelling, or as he had put it, rescheduling their trip. That had not gone over well with her at all.<br> <br>But Scot Harvath had a bad habit of telling himself things he knew weren&#x2019;t true.</p><h2>Grimm&#39;s Household Tales</h2><p>This new edition of <i>Peake's illustrated Household Tales</i> by the Brothers Grimm was originally published in 1946 and this is the first time it has been made available since then with the original color illustrations.

The killers inside watched three teenagers, two boys and a girl, hurrying along the sidewalk like windblown leaves. The kids were getting somewhere quick, finding shelter before the storm. </p><p>The killers trailed them, saw them off, then turned their faces toward Oak Walk. </p><p>The mansion was an architectural remnant of the nineteenth century, red brick with green trim, gloomy and looming in the dying light. Along the wrought-iron fence, well-tended beds of blue and yellow iris, and clumps of pink peonies, were going gray to the eye. </p><p>Oak Walk was perched on a bluff. The back of the house looked across the lights of St. Paul, down into the valley of the Mississippi, where the groove of the river had already gone dark. The front faced Summit Avenue; Oak Walk was the second-richest house on the richest street in town. </p><p>Six aging burr oaks covered the side yard. In sunlight, their canopies created a leafy glade, with sundials and flagstone walks, charming with moss and violets; but moon shadows gave the yard a menacing aura, now heightened by the lightning that flickered through the incoming clouds. </p><p>&#x201c;Like the Munsters should live there,&#x201d; the bigger of the killers said. </p><p>&#x201c;Like a graveyard,&#x201d; the little one agreed. </p> <p>The Weather Channel had warned of <i>tornadic events</i>, and the killers could feel a twister in the oppressive heat, the smell of ozone thick in the air. </p><p>The summer was just getting started. The last snow slipped into town on May 2, and was gone a day later. The rest of the month had been sunny and warm, and by the end of it, even the ubiquitous paper-pale blondes were showing tan lines. </p><p>Now the first of the big summer winds. Refreshing, if it didn&#x2019;t knock your house down. </p><br><br><p>ON THE FOURTH PASS, the van turned into the driveway, eased up under the portico, and the killers waited there for a porch light. No light came on. That was good. </p><p>They got out of the van, one Big, one Little, stood there for a moment, listening, obscure in the shadows, facing the huge front doors. They were wearing coveralls, of the kind worn by automotive mechanics, and hairnets, and nylon stockings over their faces. Behind them, the van&#x2019;s engine ticked as it cooled. A Wisconsin license plate, stolen from a similar vehicle in a 3M parking lot, was stuck on the back of the van. </p><p>Big said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201d; </p><p>Little led the way up the porch steps. After a last quick look around, Big nodded again, and Little pushed the doorbell. </p><p>They&#x2019;d done this before. They were good at it. </p><br><br><p>THEY COULD FEEL the footsteps on the wooden floors inside the house. &#x201c;Ready,&#x201d; said Big. </p><p>A moment later, one of the doors opened. A shaft of light cracked across the porch, flashing on Little&#x2019;s burgundy jacket. Little said a few words&#x2014;&#x201c;Miz Peebles? Is this where the party is?&#x201d; </p><p>A slender black woman, sixtyish, Peebles said, &#x201c;Why no . . .&#x201d; Her jaw continued to work wordlessly, searching for a scream, as she took in the distorted faces. </p><p>Little was looking past her at an empty hallway. The groundskeeper and the cook were home, snug in bed. This polite inquiry at the door was a last-minute check to make sure that there were no unexpected guests. Seeing no one, Little stepped back and snapped, &#x201c;Go.&#x201d; </p><p>Big went through the door, fast, one arm flashing in the interior light. Big was carrying a two-foot-long steel gas pipe, with gaffer tape wrapped around the handle-end. Peebles didn&#x2019;t scream, because she didn&#x2019;t have time. Her eyes widened, her mouth dropped open, one hand started up, and then Big hit her on the crown of her head, crushing her skull. </p><p>The old woman dropped like a sack of bones. Big hit her again, as insurance, and then a third time, as insurance on the insurance: three heavy floor-shaking impacts, <i>whack! whack! whack! </i></p><br><br><p>THEN A VOICE from up the stairs, tentative, shaky. &#x201c;Sugar? Who was it, Sugar?&#x201d; </p><p>Big&#x2019;s head turned toward the stairs and Little could hear him breathing. Big slipped out of his loafers and hurried up the stairs in his stocking feet, a man on the hunt. Little stepped up the hall, grabbed a corner of a seven-foot-long Persian carpet and dragged it back to the black woman&#x2019;s body. </p><p>And from upstairs, three more impacts: a gasping, thready scream, and <i>whack! whack! whack!</i> </p><p>Little smiled. Murder&#x2014;and the insurance. </p><p>Little stooped, caught the sleeve of Peebles&#x2019;s housecoat, and rolled her onto the carpet. Breathing a little harder, Little began dragging the carpet toward an interior hallway that ran down to the kitchen, where it&#x2019;d be out of sight of any of the windows. A pencil-thin line of blood, like a slug&#x2019;s trail, tracked the rug across the hardwood floor. </p><p>Peebles&#x2019;s face had gone slack. Her eyes were still open, the eyeballs rolled up, white against her black face. Too bad about the rug, Little thought. Chinese, the original dark blue gone pale, maybe 1890. Not a great rug, but a good one. Of course, it&#x2019;d need a good cleaning now, with the blood-puddle under Peebles&#x2019;s head. </p><br><br><p>OUTSIDE, there&#x2019;d been no sound of murder. No screams or gunshots audible on the street. A window lit up on Oak Walk&#x2019;s second floor. Then another on the third floor, and yet another, on the first floor, in the back, in the butler&#x2019;s pantry: Big and Little, checking out the house, making sure that they were the only living creatures inside. </p><br><br><p>WHEN THEY KNEW that the house was clear, Big and Little met at the bottom of the staircase. Big&#x2019;s mouth under the nylon was a bloody O. He&#x2019;d chewed into his bottom lip while killing the old woman upstairs, something he did when the frenzy was on him. He was carrying a jewelry box and one hand was closed in a fist. </p><p>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t believe this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;She had it around her neck.&#x201d; He opened his fist&#x2014;his hands were covered with latex kitchen gloves&#x2014;to show off a diamond the size of a quail&#x2019;s egg. </p><p>&#x201c;Is it real?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s real and it&#x2019;s blue. We&#x2019;re not talking Boxsters anymore. We&#x2019;re talking SLs.&#x201d; Big opened the box. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s more: earrings, a necklace. There could be a half million, right here.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Can Fleckstein handle it?&#x201d; </p><p>Big snorted. &#x201c;Fleckstein&#x2019;s so dirty that he wouldn&#x2019;t recognize the <i>Mona Lisa</i>. He&#x2019;ll handle it.&#x201d; </p><p>He pushed the jewelry at Little, started to turn, caught sight of Peebles lying on the rug. &#x201c;Bitch,&#x201d; he said, the word grating through his teeth. &#x201c;Bitch.&#x201d; In a second, in three long steps, he was on her again, beating the dead woman with the pipe, heavy impacts shaking the floor. Little went after him, catching him after the first three impacts, pulling him away, voice hard, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s gone, for Christ&#x2019;s sakes, she&#x2019;s gone, she&#x2019;s gone . . .&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Fucker,&#x201d; Big said. &#x201c;Piece of shit.&#x201d; </p><p>Little thought, sometimes, that Big should have a bolt through his neck. </p><p>Big stopped, and straightened, looked down at Peebles, muttered, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d; He shuddered, and said, &#x201c;Gone.&#x201d; Then he turned to Little, blood in his eye, hefting the pipe. </p><p>Little&#x2019;s hands came up: &#x201c;No, no&#x2014;it&#x2019;s me. It&#x2019;s me. For God&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d; </p><p>Big shuddered again. &#x201c;Yeah, yeah. I know. It&#x2019;s you.&#x201d; </p><p>Little took a step back, still uncertain, and said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get to work. Are you okay? Let&#x2019;s get to work.&#x201d; </p><p>Twenty minutes after they went in, the front door opened again. Big came out, looked both ways, climbed into the van, and eased it around the corner of the house and down the side to the deliveries entrance. Because of the pitch of the slope at the back of the house, the van was no longer visible from the street. </p><p>The last light was gone, the night now as dark as a coal sack, the lightning flashes closer, the wind coming like a cold open palm, pushing against Big&#x2019;s face as he got out of the van. A raindrop, fat and round as a marble, hit the toe of his shoe. Then another, then more, cold, going pat-pat . . . pat . . . pat-pat-pat on the blacktop and concrete and brick. </p><p>He hustled up to the back door; Little opened it from the inside. </p><p>&#x201c;Another surprise,&#x201d; Little said, holding up a painting, turning it over in the thin light. Big squinted at it, then looked at Little: &#x201c;We agreed we wouldn&#x2019;t take anything off the walls.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t on the walls,&#x201d; Little said. &#x201c;It was stuffed away in the storage room. It&#x2019;s not on the insurance list.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Amazing. Maybe we ought to quit now, while we&#x2019;re ahead.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Little&#x2019;s voice was husky with greed. &#x201c;This time . . . this time, we can cash out. We&#x2019;ll never have to do this again.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind,&#x201d; Big said. </p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t mind the killing, but how about thirty years in a cage? Think you&#x2019;d mind <i>that</i>?&#x201d; </p><p>Big seemed to ponder that for a moment, then said, &#x201c;All right.&#x201d; </p><p>Little nodded. &#x201c;Think about the SLs. Chocolate for you, silver for me. Apartments: New York and Los Angeles. Something right on the Park, in New York. Something where you can lean out the window, and see the Met.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We could buy . . .&#x201d; Big thought about it for a few more seconds. &#x201c;Maybe . . . a Picasso?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A Picasso . . .&#x201d; Little thought about it, nodded. &#x201c;But first&#x2014;I&#x2019;m going back upstairs. And you . . .&#x201d; </p><p>Big grinned under the mask. &#x201c;I trash the place. God, I love this job.&#x201d; </p><br><br><p>OUTSIDE, across the back lawn, down the bluff, over the top of the United Hospital buildings and Seventh Street and the houses below, down three-quarters of a mile away, a towboat pushed a line of barges toward the moorings at Pig&#x2019;s Eye. Not hurrying. Tows never hurried. All around, the lights of St. Paul sparkled like diamonds, on the first line of bluffs, on the second line below the cathedral, on the bridges fore and aft, on the High Bridge coming up. </p><p>The pilot in the wheelhouse was looking up the hill at the lights of Oak Walk, Dove Hill, and the Hill House, happened to be looking when the lights dimmed, all at once. </p><p>The rain-front had topped the bluff and was coming down on the river. </p><p>Hard rain coming, the pilot thought. <i>Hard </i>rain. </p></p><h2>Basic Rug Hooking</h2><p>Now revised and updated, this has become the standard introduction to making wool rugs with the traditional handheld hook.

In 1986, twenty-year-old Christopher Knight left his home in Massachusetts, drove to Maine, and disappeared into the woods. He would not have a conversation with another human being until nearly three decades later when he was arrested for stealing food. Living in a tent even in winter, he had survived by his wits and courage, developing ingenious ways to store food and water, to avoid freezing to death. He broke into nearby cottages for food, clothes, reading material, and other provisions, taking only what he needed, but terrifying a community never able to solve the mysterious burglaries. Based on extensive interviews with Knight himself, this is a vividly detailed account of the why and how of his secluded life--as well as the challenges he has faced returning to the world. A riveting story of survival that asks fundamental questions about solitude, community, and what makes a good life, and a deeply moving portrait of a man who was determined to live his own way, and succeeded&#34;--Publisher description.</p><p><b>MICHAEL FINKEL</b> is the author of <i>True Story: Murder, Memoir, Mea Culpa</i>, which was adapted into a 2015 major motion picture. He has written for <i>National Geographic</i>, <i>GQ</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, and <i>The</i> <i>New York Times Magazine</i>. He lives in western Montana.<b>Chapter 16</b><br><br>Knight lived in the dirt but was cleaner than you. Way cleaner. Pine needles and mud don&#x2019;t make you dirty, except superficially. The muck that matters, the bad bacteria, the evil virus, is typically passed through coughs and sneezes and handshakes and kisses. The price of sociability is sometimes our health. Knight quarantined himself from the human race and thus avoided our biohazards. He stayed phenomenally healthy. Though he suffered deeply at times, he insists he never once had a medical emergency, or a serious illness, or a bad accident, or even a cold.<br><br>During the summers, especially in the early years, he was strong, fit, and spry. &#x201c;You should have seen me in my twenties&#x2014;I ruled the land I walked upon, it was mine,&#x201d; Knight said, exposing the prideful streak that runs below his surface of contrition. &#x201c;Why shouldn&#x2019;t I claim it as my own? No one else was there. I was in control. I controlled it as much as I wanted. I was lord of the woods.&#x201d;<br><br>Poison ivy grows throughout the area; its prevalence prevented some people from searching for his site. Knight kept&nbsp;a little jingle in his head&#x2014;&#x201c;leaves of three, let it be&#x201d;&#x2014;and so ably memorized where each patch grew that even at night he didn&#x2019;t brush against it. He says he was never once afflicted.<br><br>Lyme disease, a bacterial illness transmitted through tick bites that can cause partial paralysis, is endemic to central Maine, but Knight was spared that as well. He brooded about Lyme for a while, then came to a realization: &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t do anything about it, so I stopped thinking about it.&#x201d;<br><br>Living in the woods, subject to the whims of nature, offers a great deal of autonomy but not much control. At first, Knight worried about everything: snowstorms might bury him, hikers could find him, the police would capture him. Gradually, methodically, he shed most of his anxiety.<br><br>But not all. Being too relaxed, he felt, was also a danger. In appropriate doses, worry was useful, possibly lifesaving. &#x201c;I used worry to encourage thought,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Worry can give you an extra prod to survive and plan. And I had to plan.&#x201d;<br><br>At the conclusion of each thieving mission, he was absolved temporarily of worry. The order in which he ate his food was governed by the pace of spoilage, ground beef to Twinkies. When he was down to little more than flour and shortening, he&#x2019;d mix those together with water and make biscuits. He never stole homemade meals or unwrapped items, for fear someone might poison him, so everything he took came sealed in a carton or can. He ate every morsel, scraping the containers clean. Then he deposited the wrappers and cartons in his camp&#x2019;s dump, stuffed between boulders at the boundary of his site.<br><br>The dump was scattered over an area of about a hundred&nbsp;square feet. One section was devoted to items like propane tanks and old mattresses and sleeping bags and books, another to food containers. Even in the food area, there was no odor. Knight added layers of dirt and leaves to aid with composting, which eliminated any smell, but most of the packaging was waxed cardboard or plastic, slow to disintegrate. Upon excavation, the colors on many boxes remained garish, superlatives and exclamation points and rococo typography popping from the soil while robins chirped in the branches above.<br><br>The archeological record contained in his dump revealed why Knight&#x2019;s only significant health issue was his teeth. He brushed regularly, he stole toothpaste, but did not see a dentist and his teeth began to rot. It didn&#x2019;t help that his culinary preferences never progressed beyond the sugar-and-processedfood palate of a teenager. &#x201c; &#x2018;Cooking&#x2019; is too kind a word for what I did,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>A staple meal was macaroni and cheese. Dozens of macand-cheese boxes were buried between the rocks, along with several empty spice bottles&#x2014;black pepper, garlic powder, hot sauce, blackened seasoning. Often, when Knight was inside a cabin with a good spice rack, he would grab a new bottle and try it out on his macaroni and cheese.<br><br>Also in his dump was a flattened thirty-ounce container from cheddar-flavored Goldfish crackers, a five-pound tub from Marshmallow Fluff, and a box that had held sixteen Drake&#x2019;s Devil Dogs. There were packages from graham crackers, tater tots, baked beans, shredded cheese, hot dogs, maple syrup, chocolate bars, cookie dough. Betty Crocker scalloped potatoes and Tyson chicken strips. Country Time&nbsp;lemonade and Mountain Dew. El Monterey spicy jalape�o and cheese chimichangas.<br><br>All of this came from a single kitchen-sink-sized hole, dug out by hand. Knight had fled the modern world only to live off the fat of it. The food, Knight pointed out, wasn&#x2019;t exactly his choice. It was first selected by the cabin owners of North Pond, then snatched by him. He did steal a little money, an average of fifteen dollars a year&#x2014;&#x201c;a backup system,&#x201d; he called it&#x2014;and lived an hour&#x2019;s walk from the Sweet Dreams convenience store and deli, but never went there. The last time he ate at a restaurant, or even sat at a table, was at some fast-food place during his final road trip.<br><br>He stole frozen lasagna, canned ravioli, and Thousand Island dressing. You can dig in the dump until you&#x2019;re lying on your side, arm buried to the shoulder, and more keeps emerging. Cheetos and bratwurst and pudding and pickles. Quarry a trench deep enough to fight a war from&#x2014;Crystal Light, Cool Whip, Chock full o&#x2019;Nuts, Coke&#x2014;and you still won&#x2019;t reach bottom.<br><br>So he wasn&#x2019;t a gourmet. He didn&#x2019;t care what he ate. &#x201c;The discipline I practiced in order to survive did away with cravings for specific food. As long as it was food, it was good enough.&#x201d; He spent no more than a few minutes preparing meals, yet he often passed the fortnight between raids without leaving camp, filling much of the time with chores, camp maintenance, hygiene, and entertainment.<br><br>His chief form of entertainment was reading. The last moments he was in a cabin were usually spent scanning bookshelves and nightstands. The life inside a book always felt&nbsp;welcoming to Knight. It pressed no demands on him, while the world of actual human interactions was so complex. Conversations between people can move like tennis games, swift and unpredictable. There are constant subtle visual and verbal cues, there&#x2019;s innuendo, sarcasm, body language, tone. Everyone occasionally fumbles an encounter, a victim of social clumsiness. It&#x2019;s part of being human.<br><br>To Knight, it all felt impossible. His engagement with the written word might have been the closest he could come to genuine human encounters. The stretch of days between thieving raids allowed him to tumble into the pages, and if he felt transported he could float in bookworld, undisturbed, for as long as he pleased.<br><br>The reading selection offered by the cabins was often dispiriting. With books, Knight did have specific desires and cravings&#x2014;in some ways, reading material was more important to him than food&#x2014;though when he was famished for words, he&#x2019;d subsist on whatever the nightstands bestowed, highbrow or low.<br><br>He liked Shakespeare,<i> Julius Caesar</i> especially, that litany of betrayal and violence. He marveled at the poetry of Emily Dickinson, sensing her kindred spirit. For the last seventeen years of her life, Dickinson rarely left her home in Massachusetts and spoke to visitors only through a partly closed door. &#x201c;Saying nothing,&#x201d; she wrote, &#x201c;sometimes says the most.&#x201d;<br><br>Knight wished he&#x2019;d been able to procure more poetry written by Edna St. Vincent Millay, a fellow native of Maine, born in the coastal village of Rockland in 1892. He quoted her bestknown lines&#x2014;&#x201c;My candle burns at both ends / It will not last&nbsp;the night&#x201d;&#x2014;and then added, &#x201c;I tried candles in my camp for a number of years. Not worth it to steal them.&#x201d;<br><br>If he were forced to select a favorite book, it might be <i>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</i>, by William Shirer. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s concise,&#x201d; Knight said, a quick twelve hundred pages, &#x201c;and impressive as any novel.&#x201d; He stole every book on military history he saw<br><br>He pilfered a copy of <i>Ulysses</i>, but it was possibly the one book he did not finish. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the point of it? I suspect it was a bit of a joke by Joyce. He just kept his mouth shut as people read into it more than there was. Pseudo-intellectuals love to drop the name <i>Ulysses </i>as their favorite book. I refused to be intellectually bullied into finishing it.&#x201d;<br><br>Knight&#x2019;s disdain for Thoreau was bottomless&#x2014;&#x201c;he had no deep insight into nature&#x201d;&#x2014;but Ralph Waldo Emerson was acceptable. &#x201c;People are to be taken in very small doses,&#x201d; wrote Emerson. &#x201c;Nothing can bring you peace but yourself.&#x201d; Knight read the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> and felt a deep-rooted connection to the verses. &#x201c;Good walking,&#x201d; says the <i>Tao</i>, &#x201c;leaves no tracks.&#x201d;<br><br>Robert Frost received a thumbs-down&#x2014;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad his reputation is starting to fade&#x201d;&#x2014;and Knight said that when he ran out of toilet paper, he sometimes tore pages from John Grisham novels. He mentioned that he didn&#x2019;t like Jack Kerouac either, but this wasn&#x2019;t quite true. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like people who like Jack Kerouac,&#x201d; he clarified.<br><br>Knight stole portable radios and earbuds and tuned in daily, voices through the waves another kind of human presence. For a while he was fascinated by talk radio. He listened to a lot of Rush Limbaugh. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say I liked him. I said I&nbsp;listened to him.&#x201d; Knight&#x2019;s own politics were &#x201c;conservative but not Republican.&#x201d; He added, perhaps unnecessarily, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m kind of an isolationist.&#x201d;<br><br>Later he got hooked on classical music&#x2014;Brahms and Tchaikovsky, yes; Bach, no. &#x201c;Bach is too pristine,&#x201d; he said. Bliss for him was Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s<i> The Queen of Spades</i>. But his undying passion was classic rock: the Who, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and, above all, Lynyrd Skynyrd. Nothing in all the world received higher praise from Knight than Lynyrd Skynyrd. &#x201c;They will be playing Lynyrd Skynyrd songs in a thousand years,&#x201d; he proclaimed.<br><br>On one raid he stole a Panasonic black-and-white fiveinch-diagonal television. This was why he needed so many car and boat batteries&#x2014;to power the TV. Knight was adept at wiring batteries together, in series and parallel. He also carried off an antenna and hid it high in his treetops.<br><br>He said that everything shown on PBS was &#x201c;carefully crafted for liberal baby boomers with college degrees,&#x201d; but the best thing he watched while in the woods was a PBS program, Ken Burns&#x2019;s documentary <i>The Civil War</i>. He was able to recite parts of the show verbatim. &#x201c;I still remember Sullivan Ballou&#x2019;s letter to his wife,&#x201d; said Knight. &#x201c;It brought tears to my eyes.&#x201d; Ballou, a major in the Union army, wrote to Sarah on July 14, 1861, and was killed at the First Battle of Bull Run before the letter was delivered. The note spoke of &#x201c;unbounded love&#x201d; for his children, and Ballou said his heart was attached to his wife&#x2019;s &#x201c;with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break&#x201d;&#x2014;an expression of human connection that made Knight weep, even if he wasn&#x2019;t compelled to seek it himself.<br><br>Knight was aware of world events and politics, but he seldom had any reaction. Everything seemed to be happening far away. He burned through all his batteries after September 11, 2001, and never watched television again. &#x201c;Car batteries were so heavy and difficult to steal anyway,&#x201d; he said. He repurposed the ones he had as anchor weights for guylines, and after he stole a radio that received television audio signals, he switched to listening to TV stations on the radio; &#x201c;theater of the mind,&#x201d; he called it. <i>Seinfeld </i>and <i>Everybody Loves Raymond</i> were his television-on-the-radio favorites.<br><br>&#x201c;I do have a sense of humor,&#x201d; Knight said. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t like jokes. Freud said there&#x2019;s no such thing as a joke&#x2014;a joke is an expression of veiled hostility.&#x201d; His favorite comedians were the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, and George Carlin. The last movie he saw in a theater was the 1984 comedy <i>Ghostbusters</i>.<br><br>He never bothered listening to sports; they bored him, every one of them. For news, there were five-minute updates at the top of the hour on WTOS, the Mountain of Pure Rock, out of Augusta. Also, he said, he sometimes listened to French news stations out of Quebec. He didn&#x2019;t speak French, but he understood most of it.<br><br>He liked handheld video games. His rule for stealing them was that they had to appear outdated; he didn&#x2019;t want to take a kid&#x2019;s new one. He&#x2019;d be stealing those in a couple years anyway. He enjoyed Pok�mon, Tetris, and Dig Dug. &#x201c;I like games that require thought and strategy. No shoot-&#x2019;em-ups. No mindless repetitive motion.&#x201d; Electronic Sudoku was great, and crossword puzzles in magazines were welcome challenges, but he&nbsp;never took a deck of cards to play solitaire, and he doesn&#x2019;t like chess. &#x201c;Chess is too two-dimensional, too finite of a game.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t create any sort of art&#x2014;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not that type of person&#x201d;&#x2014;nor did he spend any nights away from his camp. &#x201c;I have no desire to travel. I read. That&#x2019;s my form of travel.&#x201d; He never even glimpsed Maine&#x2019;s celebrated coastline. He claimed that he did not speak to himself aloud, not a word. &#x201c;Oh, you mean like typical hermit behavior, huh? No, never.&#x201d;<br><br>Not for a moment did he consider keeping a journal. He would never allow anyone to read his private thoughts; therefore, he did not risk writing them down. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather take it to my grave,&#x201d; he said. And anyway, when was a journal ever honest? &#x201c;It either tells a lot of truths to cover a single lie,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;or a lot of lies to cover a single truth.&#x201d;<br><br>Knight&#x2019;s ability to hold a grudge was impressive. Though many <i>National Geographic</i> magazines were buried beneath his tent, he despised the publication. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t even like stealing them,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I only looked at them when I was desperate. They&#x2019;re really only good for burying in the dirt. That glossy paper lasts a long time.&#x201d;<br><br>His aversion to <i>National Geographic</i> extends back to his youth. When Knight was in high school, he was reading a copy and came across a photo of a young Peruvian shepherd standing beside a road, crying. Behind him were several dead sheep, struck by a car as the boy had been trying to guide them. The photograph was later reprinted in a book of <i>National Geographic</i>&#x2019;s all-time greatest portraits.<br><br>It incensed Knight. &#x201c;They published a photo of the boy&#x2019;s humiliation. He had failed his family, who had entrusted him&nbsp;with the herd. It&#x2019;s disgusting that everybody can see a little boy&#x2019;s failure.&#x201d; Knight, still furious about the image thirty years later, was a man acutely attuned to the ravages of shame. Had he done something shameful before he&#x2019;d fled to the forest? He insisted that he had not.<br><br>Knight had a strong distaste for big cities, filled with helpless intellectuals, people with multiple degrees who couldn&#x2019;t change a car&#x2019;s oil. But, he added, it wasn&#x2019;t as if rural areas were Valhalla. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t glorify the country,&#x201d; he said, then tossed off a line from the first chapter of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i> about escaping &#x201c;the idiocy of rural life.&#x201d;<br><br>He acknowledged, forthrightly, that a couple of cabins were enticing because of their subscriptions to <i>Playboy</i>. He was curious. He was only twenty years old when he disappeared, and had never been out on a date. He imagine...</p><h2>Moscow to the End of the Line</h2><p>Title: Moscow to the End of the Line &lt;&gt;Binding: Paperback &lt;&gt;Author: VenediktErofeev &lt;&gt;Publisher: NorthwesternUniversityPress</p><p>In this classic novel of Russian humor and social commentary, a cable fitter is fired from his job after accidentally sending out detailed graphs charting his coworkers&#39; productivity against the amount of alcohol they consumed.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>ANTIPASTI AND OTHER APPETIZERS: GLI ANTIPASTI</h2><p>Gathers recipes for salads, stuffed vegetables, grilled breads, and appetizers that feature fish and meat</p><p>For anyone who doesn't like meals, antipasti can stand in for them. Others sneak in these snacks before the real meal begins. Del Conte, a Milan-born teacher and writer ( Gastronomy of Italy ), here condenses what she knows into a brief but appealing volume. Some of the strong recipes include those for grilled bell peppers; baked zucchini with mint and garlic stuffing; carrots in wine and herb (parsley, thyme, mint, sage) sauce; and stuffed mussels. The vegetarian entries will satisfy across the board, but meat eaters will not go hungry: a warm seafood salad, for example, incorporates shrimp, monkfish, squid, mussels and scallops, while "Il Mio Carpaccio"--which sounds like a spoof on an aria--calls for raw beef. The author claims she was once "transfixed by the beauty of the food and bewildered by the choice." Bayley's watercolors remind us of that beauty in ethereal views of sausages; a mottled pear; a sanguine fish. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.These charming little volumes are two of the first in a new series from a well-known authority on Italian cuisine (also available are Il Risotti: Risottos and Other Rice Dishes and Il Dolci: Sweet Things ).

Howard, C.L. Moore, and Manly Wade Wellman</p><p>This second collection of work by some of the great SF pulp masters contains some stories well worth saving, as well as explanatory material on how they came to be written. In the best of the tales, "Lorelei of the Red Mist" (begun by Leigh Brackett, who turned it over to Ray Bradbury to finish), a thief fleeing police on Venus crashes his aircraft and wakes to find himself in a new body and involved in a war between humans and people of amphibious origin. "Quest of the Starstone" and three other stories by C. L. Moore feature her outlaw of the spaceways, Northwest Smith. In "Quest," Smith and Moore's other great protagonist, Jirel of Joiry, are brought together across the centuries by a vengeance-seeking magician. In "Werewoman" Smith lifts a curse from a blighted land. Manly Wade Wellman's contribution, "Hok Visits the Land of Legends," follows the Cro-Magnon hero in his hunt for the largest of the mammoths and his encounter with a tribe of Piltdown Men, which he frees from bondage to an evil tyrant. Two versions of one story by Robert E. Howard, which finally saw light as "The Frost-Giant's Daughter" are really an academic exercise. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hartford (The Old Photographs Series)</h2><p>Volume I-6 1/2&#34;x9 1/4&#34; 128 page illustrated softcover on Hartford, Connecticut published in 1995-by Arcadia Publishing</p><p></p><h2>Tarzan and the Madman</h2><p>PLOT The drums boomed forth the incredible message from tribe to tribe - Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, had become an enemy to all, stealing and enslaving their women... even the daughter of an English millionaire, who offered a princely reward for her recapture and Tarzan&#39;s death.

I will say that the suspense in Nine Coaches Waiting is particularly terrific because you can never trust any of the characters and aren&#39;t quite sure who the villain is until it&#39;s almost too late. Don&#39;t miss it! Shauna Summers, Senior EditorA strange terror coiled in the shadows behind the brooding elegance of the huge chateau. It lay there like some dark and twisted thing -- waiting, watching, ready to strike. Was it only chance encounter than had brought Linda Martin to Chateau Valmy? Or was it something planned? The lovely young English governess did not know. She only knew something was wrong and that she was afraid. Now she could not even trust the man she loved.

It covers the selection and the construction of a wide range of urban buildings, and presents many detailed photographs of real buildings from which the modeller can gain ideas, identify specific features and draw inspiration. Special attention is paid to modelling architectural details and to the effects of weathering. Scratch-building techniques and materials, as well as ready-to-plant buildings and kits are covered. In addition to the buildings themselves, the author also considers the urban setting and infrastructure, and demonstrates how to construct roads and pavements, create authentic street scenes, and make realistic models that accurately reflect, for example, urban decay and dereliction. Finally, consideration is given to persepctive modelling, a concept that provides the modeller with an opportunity to make much better use of a limited amount of space.</p></p><p><p><b>David Wright</b> is a professional artist and model maker who has written numerous articles in the railway modelling press.

To complicate matters, both victims were discovered on a hidden river deep in the national forest--a place that just so happens to be a dangerous wolf rendezvous site.<br><br>Lew recruits her close friend and fellow flyfisherman, retired dentist "Doc" Osborne, for his forensic and interrogation skills. But Doc has his own set of problems to worry about: his grandson is hospitalized with a grave illness, and now Lew seems to be getting too interested in the father of the murdered student--a well-to-do widower who is teaching her the Japanese art of tenkara flyfishing.</p><p>In her teens and twenties, mystery author Victoria Houston was the classic hometown girl who couldn't wait to leave her small Wisconsin town. She has not only returned to her hometown of Rhinelander, but she has based her popular Loon Lake mystery series in the region&#x2019;s fishing culture. She has been featured in <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>and on National Public Radio.When kayakers find a skeleton in the Nicolet National Forest near Loon Lake, Wisconsin, Police Chief Lewellyn Ferris begins a murder investigation. Soon after, at the request of her father, she undertakes a search for a missing graduate student, Liam Barber, who is finally found, shot to death in this same remote area. Complicating matters, this part of the forest is a wolf rendezvous site where wolves gather to raise their young. Even though Lew&#x2019;s friend Doc Osborne is worried about his gravely ill grandson, he is able to help out as deputy coroner. With the help of Doc, fishing guide Ray Pradt, the county sheriff, and the FBI, Lew is able to connect the cases and catch two murderers. Populated with well-drawn characters and framed with a portrait of life in small-town Wisconsin, lovingly described wilderness areas, fly-fishing details (including the Japanese fly-fishing technique tenkara), and the particulars of wolf behavior, this mystery will appeal to fans of Nevada Barr&#x2019;s Anna Pigeon novels, each of which takes place in a national park. --Sue OBrien</p><h2>North Uist in History and Legend</h2><p>Bill Lawson is the foremost authority on the detailed history of the Western Isles of Scotland, and he now follows his successful &#39;Harris in History and Legend&#39; with a companion volume of the neighbouring Isle of North Uist.</p><p>Bill Lawson founded the genealogy centre Co Leis Thu? and is genealogical consultant to Northton Heritage Trust, which now runs this research service.

The script, a collaboration with master puppet maker Ralph Lee, was created for the premiere production of the play at The Public Theater in New York in 1994.</p><p>In a Foreword to this edition, Moraga comments on her concerns about nationhood, indigenism, queer sexuality, and gender information.</p></p><p>In these two plays Cherrie Moraga traverses the landscape of tragedy and comedy to show how myth and cultural history have shaped the Chicano Imagi-Nation.Nationally recognized as a poet, essayist, and cultural organizer, Cherr�e Moraga is coeditor of the feminist multicultural anthology <i>This Bridge Called My Back</i>.

Books abound on the devotional life, on commitment, on evangelism and practical Christian living, but few take up what it means to love God with our minds. How do we learn to honor God in the ways we think? James Sire blazes a trail for Christians concerned about the discipleship of our minds. After looking at the attitudes toward God and ourselves necessary for the journey, he introduces us to the basics of the Christian world view. Separate chapters discuss the foundations of knowledge and the relationship between knowing and doing. With an eye to the practical, Sire offers specific suggestions on getting to know what is good and getting to know the world. He also provides valuable insights on how Christians might approach various academic disciplines as disciples of Christ. Here is a book for all who desire to love God with their minds.</p><p>James W.

So I was left with the name which few people remembered, and a face fewer still had seen.<br><br>The shoemaker in Rruga November 17, for instance, said, &#x2018;Yes, I know this man. We were at school together.&#x2019;<br><br>And after that?<br><br>The man shrugged. &#x2018;You asked if I knew him.&#x2019;<br><br>He thought some more.<br><br>&#x2018;Petar,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;was very good at gymnastics.&#x2019;<br><br>Kindly and well disposed towards his mother, the shoemaker added.<br><br>&#x2018;He was a dentist,&#x2019; I said.<br><br>&#x2018;I did not say that,&#x2019; said the man.<br><br>&#x2018;I know. I&#x2019;m saying it. The Petar Shapallo we are looking for was a dentist.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;If he was a dentist, then go to the dentists&#x2019; union. As you can see, I am a shoemaker.&#x2019;<br>The dentist had had the misfortune to have been born in the very same month as the Balkan dictator, Enver Hoxha.<br><br>A shared birthday wasn&#x2019;t necessary &#x2014; but one can see how it might have helped in making the dentist a persuasive candidate. The moon entering the third phase, the alignment of the planets...that sort of thing. More important was the fact of Shapallo&#x2019;s size. He was over six feet tall, and broad across the shoulder. The dentist and the dictator had perfect matching shadows. And twin smiles designed to reassure. I had heard it said: People who saw a smile cross Enver&#x2019;s face were often surprised to learn that he was ordering their execution. But just as misleading was Shapallo's smile &#x2014; that grin of a man caught in the rain without a coat or umbrella the moment he learned he was required to perform a special duty at the highest level.<br><br>Height, breadth and smiling lines &#x2014; these are the vital ingredients. The rest the surgeon sculpted. Hairdressers and tailors worked on Shapallo to improve the resemblance. The dictator occasionally looked in on the work-in-progress. His glance moved between Shapallo and his own reflection in a hand-held mirror. Once satisfied that the reflection could not be improved, he had Shapallo&#x2019;s family killed &#x2014; his wife and two daughters, ages eight and ten. Next to go were the surgeon, hairdressers and tailors. They were in the bus that toppled over the cliffs which spill down to Dhermi on the Adriatic Coast.<br><br>The years passed. Shapallo, as it happened, was spared the assassin&#x2019;s bullet and the dictator died in the mid-eighties, disabled by Parkinson&#x2019;s, a frail shadow of the comparatively robust Shapallo filling in for him on the podium. There was a ceremony for retired border guards at which Shapallo pinned medals to the chests of the veterans at the very same moment that the dictator lay on his deathbed. The death notice arrived several days later. The announcer&#x2019;s voice on Radio Tirana was solemn and grave. The grieving process thus began.<br><br>To commemorate the loss of the Great Leader an extra &#x2018;attack day&#x2019; was declared in the countryside. In Tirana people lined up to give parting kisses. They wept and threw themselves over the coffin. A woman screamed for her heart to be torn open and for Enver to be fed with her blood. This &#x2018;correct&#x2019; display of emotion was shown many times on Albanian television. Each time, a soldier with a rifle slung over his shoulder prises the woman from the coffin. The woman is led to a chair, and the line of mourners takes a step forward. On it went &#x2014; until the day of entombment arrived with the rumoured sighting of the Great Leader; like the &#x2018;Christ figure&#x2019;, Enver had risen from the dead.<br><br>The sightings spread out from Tirana to the countryside, along the coast: Vlor�, Himore, Borsh, Sarand�. Eyewitness reports spoke of a man with &#x2018;film-star looks&#x2019;. It was quiet for a spell; then a woman in Korc� recalled that, before she fainted, a man exactly like the Great Leader had tapped her on the shoulder and asked for water. This man, she said, had been exceptionally polite.<br><br>There were several more mountain sightings &#x2014; the last one in a small village tucked at the bottom of the Coraun range, which is the peaked hat on the Karaburun peninsula separating the muddy Adriatic from the Ionian Sea.<br><br>The last sighting, and one that lent credence to all the others, had come from a German embassy official in the aftermath of the rush on the foreign embassies in Tirana. In June 1990 the regime casually announced that passports could as of now be obtained from the Ministry, the extraordinary implication being that everyone was now free to travel. The controls along Embassy Row were relaxed. At first no one wished to appear too eager. Second or third in line was okay, but to head a line was risky. Along Embassy Row people began to gather. For the time being everything was orderly. But then the rumour spread beyond Tirana that the embassies were taking people in, and the dribs and drabs grew to a torrent of new arrivals. All through the night and the following day the crowd built. People arrived by train, by bus, by cart; they walked in from outlying villages. They were a crowd now and as such a powerful new voice emerged. Graffiti appeared on the stone walls comparing Hoxha with Hitler. Outside the embassies the crowd chanted the new words: &#x2018;Freedom. Democracy&#x2019;. The police fired shots in the air. They tried to shout the crowds down with the use of megaphones.<br><br>It was during the second night that Shapallo managed to climb over the iron fence into the grounds of the German embassy. A good number of fellow travellers were already huddled under blankets and Shapallo was able to wriggle down in a bed of gravel.<br><br>He came to at first light with a boot in his ribs. Then something hard &#x2014; a fist or paling &#x2014; struck his forehead. A woman screamed in his face: &#x2018;Murderer!&#x2019; He was barely awake to the fact that he was being kicked, shoved and punched back to the iron railing. Word passed among the crowds camped along Embassy Row that the ghost of the late dictator had come back to haunt and burden with guilt those seeking to leave. There was a terrible commotion. Soldiers fired shots in the air to try to break up the crowd. Shapallo was pinned to the fence inside, and those on the outside waiting to get into the embassy reached through the fence to rip his clothing. It was left to embassy officials to haul the concussed dentist to safety inside the building. A doctor was sent for &#x2014; and an earlobe was sewn back on and several cuts stitched above Shapallo&#x2019;s right eye. Two ribs had been broken and a plug of hair ripped out from his left temple.</p><h2>The Cultivation of Christmas Trees</h2><p>Cultivation of Christmas Trees by Eliot, T.S.</p><p></p><h2>Treachery's Wake: Bk. 6 (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)</h2><p>In the hope of recovering a magical item from the cargo of a shipwrecked ship, a wizard hires the Thieves&#39; Guild to obtain the artifact, but they soon discover that the wreck had not been an accident and that the trail of the artifact brings them face to face with the perils of the frozen wilderness, vicious outlaws, and unexpected enemies.

A shy and humble man by nature, Eddie Aikau became larger than life in the ocean. As a surfer, he rode the biggest waves in the world; as a lifeguard, he saved hundreds of lives from the North Shore&#x2019;s treacherous waters; and as a proud Hawaiian, he sacrificed his life to save his fellow sailors aboard the voyaging canoe Hokule'a. But more than a biography of a courageous waterman, Stuart Coleman&#x2019;s Eddie Would Go also tells the story of modern Hawaii and Eddie&#x2019;s role in the Hawaiian Renaissance during the 1970&#x2019;s. The book is based on numerous interviews with his family, friends and many of Hawaii&#x2019;s leading watermen and scholars. Coleman weaves together their memories in an exciting and informative story. By exploring his legendary life and legacy, this book will show why Eddie has become such an enduring icon in Hawaii and the surfing world.</p><p>The son of a preacher, Stuart Holmes Coleman was baptized in the small waves of Charleston, SC. While in graduate school at American University, he served as the Writer-in-Residence at St. Alban&#x2019;s School in Washington, DC.

Along the way, she muses: ``What could be more youthful than England in April? It has taken three thousand million years to create that youthfulness, those fierce young buds and frail eggs . . . .'' In discussing the critical development of life's awareness of itself, she underscores her view of the close links between prehistory and civilization: ``Nothing but some fifteen hundred million years separates the first pieces of life from Proust,'' whom she envisions as a ``naked nerve at the centre of a trembling web of remembered consciousness.'' In conclusion, she denounces the ravages wreaked by massive industrialization on both the land and the human spirit and mounts an eloquent plea for a return to a holistic philosophy.

This book begins with the four on-board ship, with Laurence a stowaway and Maura, Patrick, and Mr. Drabble traveling in steerage. True to its Dickensian flavor, the villains are also on board. On arrival in Boston, all end up in the mill city of Lowell, MA. Patrick and Maura's father has died and the children find themselves facing anti-Irish sentiment, a greedy mill owner, poverty, inhuman working conditions, and, of course, all the villains. The action jumps back and forth from one person to another as their paths cross and recross. All characters "coincidentally" come together at the climax and the villains are vanquished. This is a well-written, but overly ambitious work that suffers from an overabundance of characters. The lack of a major hero and a primary villain fragments the work. Character development is minimal and the many different plots stop and start so often that the focus is lost. Avi's ability to use words and dialogue to develop a strong sense of time and place is evident and his theme that all people are created equal and that evil cannot be blamed on anything but evil individuals is strongly and clearly presented. For that reader who enjoys a well-written historical novel and who will not be deterred by the two-volume length or the complexity of the plots, this will satisfy if not excite.?Wendy D.

Harvey, who started out in New York as a ``pot walloper'' (dishwasher), longed for his own first-class restaurant. When he took a job as a railroad freight agent to finance his dream he saw a chance to replace the notoriously bad station cafe food with fine fare in quality restaurants. ``Harvey Houses'' on the Santa Fe line became legendary not only for their meals but also for sterling service by waitresses recruited and trained in the ``Harvey way.'' Farm girls, widows, immigrants, adventurers--they answered Harvey's newspaper ads for attractive and intelligent young women ``of good moral character,'' lived in dormitories, donned smart uniforms, and served cowpokes and miners from Kansas to California. Retired waitresses report a happy, convivial life and a demanding but fairly enlightened employer who offered opportunities (primarily to whites) for advancement and education through booms and busts. Before the decline of passenger trains after WW II, some 100,000 spunky young women had worked in 100 Harvey establishments, pioneering the way West for other working women. Interesting b&amp;w photos (with brief captions) amplify the cheerful text; source notes; bibliography; index. (Nonfiction. 10+) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 5-9-The story of the adventurous and talented women who left the East and Midwest to work in the renowned Sante Fe Railroad restaurant chain established by Fred Harvey after the Civil War, and which continued to operate until 1950. These carefully groomed, capable waitresses and hostesses had a civilizing effect on the rough men of the frontier, and "...played as big a part in settling the West as most men who traveled to this region during the latter half of the nineteenth century." The book is well researched, and Morris makes excellent use of comments gleaned from interviews with former Harvey Girls. The narrative is lively, conversational, and spiced with wry humor that will interest even reluctant readers. It includes descriptions of railroad towns in the unsettled West, points out the importance of Harvey's entrepreneurial talents, and briefly explains the rise and fall of the railroads. The book is illustrated with many black-and-white photos of the restaurants and of the women who devoted years of service to them. A solid treatment of an aspect of Western history seldom considered in other texts.<br><i> Phyllis Graves, Creekwood Middle School, Kingwood, TX</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Killing Room</h2><p>Beijing detective Li Yan travels to the capital of China&#39;s economic revolution to investigate, and finds the most horrifying catalogue of killings ever uncovered in the Middle Kingdom. American pathologist Margaret Campbell arrives to conduct the autopsies, only to discover her relationship with Li threatened by the policewoman leading the investigation. But each of them is faced with their own personal nightmare when the investigation uncovers a ruthless killer of inhuman capacity.</p><p>Peter May has been a journalist (Scotsman, Glasgow Evening Times), a writer on the hugely successful Scottish TV soap opera Take the High Road and the creator of three TV series: The Standard, Squadron and Machair, which is the Gaelic-language equivalent of Brookside. He spent six months in China, much of it researching his first novel, THE FIREMAKER.<b>The Killing Room</b><br><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><b>I</b>"<b>D</b>eputy Section Chief Li." The defense lawyer spoke slowly, as if considering every syllable. "There is no doubt that if one compares these shoe prints with the photographs of the footprints taken at the scene of the murder, one would be led to the conclusion that they were made by the same pair of shoes." Photographs of the footprints and the corresponding shoe prints were laid out on the table in front of him.Li Yan nodded cautiously, uncertain where this was leading, aware of the judge watching him closely from the bench opposite, a wily, white-haired veteran languishing thoughtfully in his winter blue uniform beneath the red, blue, and gold crest of the Ministry of Public Security. The scribble of the clerk's pen was clearly audible in the silence of the packed courtroom."Which would further lead one to the conclusion that the owner of these shoes was, at the very least, present at the crime scene--particularly in light of the prosecution's claim that tracesof the victim's blood were also found on the shoes." The lawyer looked up from his table and fixed Li with a cold stare. He was a young man, in his early thirties, about the same age as Li, one of a new breed of lawyers feeding off the recent raft of legislation regulating the burgeoning Chinese justice system. He was sleek, well-groomed, prosperous. A dark Armani suit, a crisp white, button-down designer shirt and silk tie. And he was brimming with a self-confidence that made Li uneasy. "Would you agree?"Li nodded."I'm sorry, did you speak?""No, I nodded my agreement." Irritation in Li's voice."Then please speak up, Deputy Section Chief, so that the clerk can note your comments for the record." The Armani suit's tone was condescending, providing the court with the erroneous impression that the police officer in the witness stand was a rank novice.Li bristled. This was a cut-and-dried case. The defendant had come in from the countryside claiming to be looking for work in Beijing. He had broken into a home in the northeast of the city, and when the occupant, an elderly widow, had startled him, had stabbed her to death. There had been copious amounts of blood. The next day the warden at a workers' hostel had called the local public security bureau to report that one of his residents had returned in the middle of the night covered in what looked like blood. By the time the police got there, the defendant had somehow managed to dispose of his bloodstained clothes and showered himself clean. No murder weapon was recovered, but a pair of his shoes matched prints left in blood at the scene, and forensics found traces of the victim's blood in the treads. Li wondered why this supercilious defense lawyer seemed so confident. He didn't have to wait long to find out."You would further agree, then, that the owner of these shoes was most probably the perpetrator of the crime.""I would." Li spoke clearly, so that there could be no ambiguity."So what leads you to believe that my client was the perpetrator?"Li frowned. "They're his shoes.""Are they?""They were found in his room at the hostel. Forensic examinationfound traces of the victim's blood in the treads, and footwear impressions taken from them provided an exact match with the prints found at the scene.""So where are they?" The lawyer's eyes held Li in their unwavering gaze.For the first time Li's own confidence began to falter. "Where are what?""The shoes." This delivered with an affected weariness. "You can't claim to have found a pair of shoes in my client's room tying him to a crime scene and then fail to produce them as evidence."Li felt a hot flush rising on his cheeks. He glanced toward the procurator's table, but the prosecutor's eyes were firmly fixed on papers in front of him. "After forensics had finished with them, they were logged and tagged and--""I ask again," the lawyer interrupted, raising his voice, a voice of reason asking a not unreasonable question. "Where are they?""They were sent down to the procurator's office as exhibits for the court.""Then why are they not here for us all to see?"Li glanced at the procurator again, only this time it was anger that colored his face. Clearly the prosecution's failure to produce the shoes had been well aired before Li had even been called to give evidence. He was being made to look like an idiot. "Why don't you ask the procurator?" His voice was taut with tension."I already did. He says that his office never received them from your office."A hubbub of excited speculation buzzed around the public benches. The clerk issued a curt warning for members of the public to remain silent or be expelled from the court. Li knew perfectly well that the shoes, along with all the other evidence, had been dispatched to the procurator's office. But he also knew that there was nothing he could say or do here in the witness box that could prove it. He felt every eye in the court upon him."Surely, Deputy Section Chief, it must be obvious even to you, that without the shoes my client has no case to answer?"Li closed his eyes and breathed deeply.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Through glass doors, past a row of potted plants, Li started angrily down the steps toward the car park. The procurator chased after him, clutching a thick folder of documents. Above them rose the five stories of Central Beijing Middle Court. To their left, armed officers guarded the vehicle entrance to the holding cells, and a red Chinese flag hung limp in the winter sun over the Ministry of Public Security's crest of justice. Justice! Li thought not. He pulled on a greatcoat over his green uniform and hauled a peaked cap down over his flattop crew cut. His breath billowed before him like dragon fire in the cold morning air."I'm telling you, we never got them." The procurator was a short, spindly man with thinning hair and thick glasses. His uniform was too large for him."Bullshit!" Li wheeled around on the steps and the procurator came to an abrupt halt on the step above. Li still towered over him. "You would never have brought the case to court if we hadn't provided the evidence.""Paper evidence. That's all you sent me. I assumed the shoes had been lodged in the evidence depository.""They were. Which makes them your responsibility, not ours." Li raised his arms with his voice, and people flooding out of the court behind them stopped to listen. "In the name of the sky, Zhang! My people work their butts off to bring criminals to justice ..." He was distracted momentarily by the sight of the Armani suit and his exultant client passing them on the steps. He had a powerful urge to take his fist and smash their gloating faces to a pulp. But he turned instead to vent his anger on the procurator. "And you fucking people go losing the evidence and let killers walk free. Expect an official complaint." He clamped a cigarette in his mouth and headed off down the steps. Procurator Zhang was fuming and only too aware of curious faces watching him. Policemen did not speak to procurators like that. Certainly not in public. It was a humiliating loss of face."I'm the one who'll be making the complaint, Deputy Section Chief," Zhang shouted lamely at Li's back. "To the commissioner. You needn't think you can live in the protective shadow of your uncle forever."Li stopped and turned, fixing him with a silent stare filled withsuch intensity that Zhang could not maintain eye contact. He knew he had gone too far and ran back up the steps into the safety of the courthouse.Li stared after him for a few moments, then hurried through the parked vehicles to the street, still fighting his anger. A group of people standing at the notice board where the week's trials were posted in advance turned to watch as he strode past. But he didn't notice them. Neither did he see the vendor at the corner of the street offering him fruit from under a green and yellow striped awning. Nor did he smell the smoke rising from lamb skewers cooking on open coals in the narrow confines of Xidamochang Street. He turned toward the roar of traffic on East Qianmen Avenue, ignoring the honk of a car's horn sounding behind him. Only when its engine revved and the horn sounded again did he half turn. An unmarked Beijing Police jeep drew alongside him. Detective Wu leaned over to push open the passenger door. Li was not pleased to see him. "What d'you want, Wu?"Wu raised his hands in mock defense. "Hey, boss, I've been waiting for you for over an hour."Li hesitated briefly before slipping into the passenger seat. "What for?"Wu grinned, jaws grinding on a piece of leathery gum that had long since lost its flavor. He pushed his sunglasses up on his forehead. He was the bearer of interesting news, and he wanted to make the most of it. "Remember that case during Spring Festival? The dismembered girl? We found her bits in a shallow grave out near the Summer Palace?""Yeah, I remember the case. We never got anyone for it." Li paused. "What about it?""They found a whole lot more just like her down in Shanghai. Some kind of mass grave. Maybe as many as twenty. Same MO.""Twenty!" Li was shocked.Wu shrugged. "They don't know for sure yet, but there are lots of bits. And they want you down there. Fast."Li was taken aback. "Me? Why?"Wu grinned. "'Cause you're such a fucking superstar, boss." But his smile froze quickly in the chill of Li's glare. "They thinkthere could be a link to the murder here in Beijing. And there's big pressure to get a result fast on this one.""Why's that?" Li had already forgotten his courtroom debacle.Wu lit a cigarette. "Seems there was this big ceremony down there this morning.

He wants it to be completely unlike the fruitcakes she usually eats during the holidays-"Something light. Something airy. Something that would not break a person's toe." Readers will discover that this is no easy undertaking since he has no pans, has never baked from scratch, and has no cookbook. This low-key holiday story focuses on the loving care that many gifts lack. Young cooks will empathize with Mr. Putter's failures and be encouraged by his persistence and eventual success. The tale's combination of concern and humor is further enhanced by the appealing pencil, watercolor, and gouache cartoons. Though this title is not as enchanting as the first two "Mr. Putter and Tabby" adventures (both Harcourt, 1994), it belongs in most beginning-to-read collections.<br><i>Gale W.

On the same night in 1940 when Joe Louis defended his heavyweight crown before 11,000 fans in New York's Madison Square Garden, collegiate boxers battled before 15,000 fans in Madison . . . Wisconsin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under legendary and beloved coach John Walsh, the most successful coach in the history of American collegiate boxing, University of Wisconsin boxers won eight NCAA team championships and thirty-eight individual titles from 1933 to 1960. Badger boxers included heroes like Woody Swancutt, who later helped initiate the Strategic Air Command, and rogues like Sidney Korshak, later the most feared mob attorney in the United States. A young fighter from Louisville named Cassius Clay also boxed in the Wisconsin Field House during this dazzling era.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in April 1960, collegiate boxing was forever changed when Charlie Mohr&#x2014; Wisconsin&#x2019;s finest and most popular boxer, an Olympic team prospect&#x2014;slipped into a coma after an NCAA tournament bout in Madison. Suddenly, not just Mohr&#x2019;s life but the entire sport of college boxing was in peril. It was to be the last NCAA boxing tournament ever held. <i>Lords of the Ring</i> tells the whole extraordinary story of boxing at the University of Wisconsin, based on dozens of interviews and extensive examination of newspaper microfilm, boxing records and memorabilia.</p><p>Terrace Books&#34;A wonderful book that brings back to life those last bittersweet days of collegiate boxing.

In the widely praised Newmarket Shooting Script(tm) series format, here is the complete shooting script of one of the best films of 1999. Also included in this volume are a fascinating essay about the screenplay and the making of the film by director Sam Mendes, an afterword by screenwriter Alan Ball recalling the genesis of the script, a twelve-page photo section, and the complete cast and crew credits.</p><p><i>"I read the screenplay and nearly fell out of bed. I thought I better meet him quick before someone else read it."</i>--Kevin Spacey<p> Actors and critics alike have praised Alan Ball's first feature film screenplay, which tells the off-kilter story of a midlife crisis suffered by Lester Burnham (played by Spacey). For fans of the film's dialogue--and there will be many--the screenplay allows Ball's words as well as the film's inventive imagery, from flying rose petals to a dancing plastic bag, to be savored. </p><p>Unfortunately for those wanting the inside scoop, this text is not the original shooting script but rather the screenplay of the final cut. But the script is so impressive, that's a minor quibble. The accompanying notes from Ball and director Sam Mendes are quite insightful, hinting at a different original ending and revealing Ball's odd inspiration for his idea: the tale of Joey Buttafuoco. Ball's TV background has made him an expert technical writer, and this book would serve as a great template for the fledgling screenwriter. It includes 20 black and white photos and a cast list. <i>--Doug Thomas</i></p><p>Academy Award�-winner for Best Original Screenplay, screenwriter Alan Ball counts <em>American Beauty</em> as his first produced feature film screenplay. He previously served as co-executive producer and writer for the television series Cybill, and also wrote for the sitcom <em>Grace Under Fire</em>. He was the creator of the critically acclaimed Golden Globe-winner for Best Television Series Six Feet Under, and served as the HBO series' executive producer.</p></p><h2>The Interlinear KJV: Parallel New Testament in Greek and English Based On the Majority Text with Lexicon and Synonyms (Greek Edition)</h2><p>2016 Reprint of the 1897 edition.

A melee caused by disguised men is brought under control, but before the troupe can lament their destroyed set Nick discovers a body in the stands with a knife sticking out of it's back. They soon realize they are out one theater and one clown: Barnaby Gill, always hilarious on the stage and hopelessly curmudgeonly off, has broken his leg.<br><br>With long months of repairs before them, Westfield's Men embark on a tour of the Kent countryside in order to salvage some of the down time. They hire a stand-in for Gill, one Gideon Mussett, a gifted comedian and an even more gifted drunk. It seems no clown is perfect; while Gill has never been a barrel of laughs when not in front of an audience, Musset simply doesn't seem to know when to quit being funny.<br><br>Their major wound bandaged, no matter how temporarily, Nick and the troupe are hoping to leave their troubles behind. But misfortune follows them at every turn, and the company finds that no matter what they do or where they go someone very sinister is just moments behind. It's up to Nick Bracewell to find out what's going on, and exactly how it ties in to their wayward comedian. Will the Vagabond Clown prophecy the end of Westfield's Men, and perhaps the demise of Nick himself? Longtime readers of mystery master Edward Marston will line up to find out in this suspenseful entry in a series that never disappoints.<br></p><p>"This was no random act of malice," proclaims stage manager Nicholas Bracewell, after an audience brawl disrupts the latest comedic performance by Westfield's Men, in Edward Marston's <i>The Vagabond Clown</i>. If there was any doubt of design behind this affray, it's quickly dispelled by the discovery of a dead spectator in the gallery, Fortunates Hope--stabbed in the back. So who wielded the dagger, and why? Bracewell and the other members of his troupe haven't the time to find out, before they are ousted from their usual stage in Elizabethan London and forced to take to the road for their income, beginning a tour of the Kent countryside that will bring them even more trouble than they could typically find in the English capital.<p> Misfortune is guaranteed when--needing a clown to stand-in for the querulous Barnaby Gill, whose leg was broken during the riot--the company hires his hated but gifted rival, Gideon Mussett. Aware of Mussett's reputation for "drunkenness and truculence," Bracewell wrests from him a pledge to behave. However, this proxy jester proves difficult to handle from the outset, and only becomes more so as his performances gain Westfield's Men acclaim. Among his supposed infractions are several prankish attacks on the injured Gill, who has insisted on traveling with Westfield's Men in order to ensure that Mussett won't try usurping his position. But Bracewell thinks fault for his company's recent adversities may lie, instead, with another, less successful band of thespians who are also traveling through the area, and whose patron knew the murdered Hope. He's convinced of their culpability after Westfield's Men are ambushed on the open road, Gill is threatened with drowning, and Giddy Mussett is assaulted in a stable. Somebody, it appears, is determined to bring the curtain down on Bracewell's band, once and for all.</p><p> The Nicholas Bracewell novels (of which <i>The Vagabond Clown</i> is the 13th) offer a fulfilling blend of hilarity and heart, romance and mystery. And Marston's flair for capturing both the upright and ribald elements of his Elizabethan setting is to be envied. If there's any disappointment in these pages, it's that a late scene involving a sea chase never achieves the swashbuckling excitement it promises. <i>--J.

Since her first SF novels were published in the 1940s, her adventure SF has enthralled readers young and old. With series such as<i> Time Traders, Solar Queen, Forerunner, Beast Master, Crosstime, </i>and <i>Janus</i>, as well as many stand-alone novels, her tales of action and adventure throughout the galaxy have drawn countless readers to science fiction. <br><br>Her fantasy, including the best-selling <i>Witch World</i> series, her "Magic" series, and many other unrelated novels, has been popular with readers for decades. Lauded as a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America, she is the recipient of a Life Achievement Award from the World Fantasy Convention. Not only have her books been enormously popular; she also has inspired several generations of SF and fantasy writers, especially many talented women writers who have followed in her footsteps. In the past two decades she has worked with other writers on a number of novels. Most notable among these are collaborations with Mercedes Lackey, the <i>Halfblood Chronicles,</i> as well as collaborations with A.C.

"Port of Dead Ships" follows Destree m'Regnant, a young woman despised by her people, the Sulcars, due to the circumstances of her birth and her powers of foreseeing. On a sea expedition to investigate disturbances to the south, her slowly maturing powers save her shipmates and the lost souls entrapped by an ancient evil that manipulates a Gate to many worlds. Griffin's ( Fire Planet ) contribution tells of the developing bond between a Holdlady of the Dales and the leader of a band of Falconers. Una of Seakeep hires the women-hating Falconers to defend her isolated hold from the depredations of her neighbor, a wrecker who wants to use her rocky coasts to lure more ships to their doom. The reluctant mercenaries take on the engagement and begin to develop bonds with the wild and beautiful Seakeep, particularly Tarlach, the leader. After a battle with men and ancient power, it remains for Una to create an answer for both peoples.

Yet for a substantial part of the 20th century this was the case, and the global telephone and telegraph services were carried through the medium of long wave and short wave radio.</p><p>This book tells the story, following the initial work of Marconi, of how radio technology developed from crude beginnings, into a reasonably sophisticated network, successfully competing against the cable network. Starting with electrical spark technology and evolving with valves, semi-conductors came late in the day for point to point radio. These systems were operated with minimal automation and a high degree of human intervention, managing and overcoming the limitations and difficulties&nbsp; of long distance radio propagation.</p><p>The relative efficiency of point to point radio and the cost of replacement satellite installations resulted in radio playing a part in international telecommunications up to the 1980&#x2019;s, giving the author direct experience of this fascinating medium.</p></p><p>Paul has spent his whole career working in radio communications. He joined the British Post Office International Telecommunication service in 1967 working at Dorchester Radio Station, then Goonhilly Satellite Station and finally Bearley HF receiving station.

Heilbrun also examines literature's silence on such vital topics as friendship between women, the female physical experience, and the richness that often imbues a women's later years. Recommended reading for everyone, especially women and writers."Astute and provocative....Blends the sophistication of recent feminist theory with highly textured details fro the lives of independent and ambitious women."<br>THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW<br>Drawing on the experience of celebrated women, from George Sand and Virginia Woolf to Dorothy Sayers and Adrienne Rich, Heilbrun examines the struggle these writers undertook when their drives made it impossible for them to follow the traditional "male" script for a woman's life.

In their first game they set an all-time attendance record and consistently drew the largest crowds of the post-World War II era. They dominated an upstart league and then silenced their detractors by doing the same to the NFL. The Browns were led by Paul Brown, a football visionary who changed pro football. Most important among his innovations was the leading role the franchise played in the integration of pro sports. While much of their competition continued with the racial exclusion of the past, the Browns featured some of the greatest black players of all-time, men who were an integral part of the Cleveland dynasty. The Best Show in Football: The 1946-1955 Cleveland Browns, Pro Football&#39;s Greatest Dynasty tells the story of those players and that dynasty. Included in that story is the construction of the Browns as well as accounts of the team&#39;s many victories. Dozens of interviews bring to life the exploits of Otto Graham, Bill Willis, Marion Motley, Lou Groza, Mac Speedie, Len Ford, Dante Lavelli, Frank Gatski, and so many others. In rich detail, The Best Show in Football demonstrates why Cleveland&#39;s dynasty was the greatest ever, greater even than several teams that are usually accorded that honor. The conclusions may be surprising but the evidence is all here. And along the way author Andy Piascik provides a wonderful trip back to football&#39;s golden age.</p><p>Well-grounded in the boisterous economic optimism of post-'45 America, Piascik's work shows how the Cleveland Browns combined savvy management and marketing, social innovativeness, brilliant coaching, and raw athletic talent to unite an already football-crazed region and create one of the most successful sports organizations in history. Were the '46-'55 Browns the greatest football dynasty ever? Piascik says yes. Let the debate begin. -- Alan H. Levy Pro football began in Ohio, and Cleveland had a pro football identity long before the 1946 Browns. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that the original Browns made pro football the integral part of the Cleveland sports scene that it remains today. The original Browns had magnificent players. A half dozen players on the very first Browns team went on to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. They were a special group of men. It is fitting that their story be told. Today's fans need to be reminded of the great impact the early Browns team had on pro football and how they influenced the game we all enjoy today. -- Mike Brown, President/Owner of the Cincinnati Bengals, and son of Paul Brown Piascik's meticulous look at the success of the Browns during their first ten years of existence, and the impact that black players had in making that success possible, should be read by any fan of pro football. -- Charles K. Ross, Author, <i>Outside the Lines: African Americans and the Integration of the National Football League<i> The Best Show in Football makes a solid case that from 1946 thru 1955, the Cleveland Browns were the greatest team in pro football history and proves beyond any reasonable doubt that they had some of the sport's greatest players and its greatest coach, Paul Brown. -- Jack Clary, Author, <i>The Cleveland Browns<i>; co-author with Paul Brown, <i>PB: The Paul Brown Story<i>; and president, Professional Footb</i></i></i></i></i></i>Andy Piascik is a long-time activist for peace and social justice.

For at least a week. Instead, she had this to deal with. <br>&#x201c;Aye, miss,&#x201d; a middle-aged balding man repeated for the third time, his patience running thin if his tightened lips were any indication. &#x201c;I am sorry, but it does happen. With all your connections out of&#x2014;&#x201d; He paused to look at her itinerary on the computer screen. &#x201c;&#x2014;Arizona, it&#x2019;s no&#x2019; surprising.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Everything I have in the world is in those two suitcases.&#x201d; She was still reeling from the cost of having had to pay for each piece of luggage as well. <br>The last few hundred dollars she had were all too quickly whittling away. And she hadn&#x2019;t even exchanged them for pounds yet. How was her money going to last her for a few months at this rate? <br>&#x201c;At least you have your carry-on.&#x201d; <br>Cassie blinked at the man before issuing a quick thank you and turning away. There was nothing left for her to do but dig out the address for the house where she was staying to the employee, and pray that somehow her luggage found its way to her. <br>She glanced at her watch and inwardly winced. Dan was going to be furious. Her brother wasn&#x2019;t known for his patience, and she&#x2019;d already wasted almost two hours dealing with the luggage fiasco. <br>But he was going to have to wait some more, because she had to pee. With her bladder about to explode, Cassie found the bathroom and struggled to get into the tiny stalls with her carry-on, jacket, and purse. <br>It wasn&#x2019;t until she was washing her hands that she dared to look into the mirror. <br>&#x201c;Dear God,&#x201d; she murmured in horror as she saw her reflection. <br>She raked her fingers through her stick-straight brown hair, which was poking up all over the place. There wasn&#x2019;t time to brush it, but Cassie did take a second to wipe away the smudges of mascara under her eyes before she hurried out of the restroom and then left the airport to the passenger pickup to look for her brother. <br>She shivered against the cold as she scanned the vehicles for the small blue car he&#x2019;d mentioned in his text, but found nothing. Worry ripped through her. It would be just like Dan to leave after having to wait so long. Renting a car wasn&#x2019;t an option either, with what little money she had left. <br>She doubted she had enough to rent half a bicycle. <br>&#x201c;Dammit, Dan,&#x201d; she mumbled. <br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; a female voice said to Cassie&#x2019;s left. <br>She turned to find another airport employee standing beside her; the woman&#x2019;s graying hair was pulled back in a severe bun. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re American, aye?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Cassie replied with a tired grin. She could only imagine what her voice sounded like to the Scots. <br>&#x201c;Is your name Cassie Hunter, by chance?&#x201d; <br>This was getting odd, but there had to be a reason the woman knew her name. &#x201c;It is.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then this is for you,&#x201d; the woman said, and pulled out a small manila envelope from her jacket and handed it to Cassie. &#x201c;A man named Dan gave this to me two days ago and said your flight would be landing this morning.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Two days ago?&#x201d; Cassie repeated as she took the envelope and felt the unmistakable heft and shape of keys inside it. What the hell was going on? &#x201c;Did he say anything else?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nay.&#x201d; The woman smiled and walked away. <br>Cassie sighed as she looked at the envelope. It was amazing what a person could get another to do when money was involved, and Dan had a lot of money. She opened the envelope and found a letter inside telling her where Dan had parked the car and also the address where she was to pick up Duke, his dog. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to kill you, Dan,&#x201d; Cassie ground out with a sniff as she dumped the keys into her icy hand. <br>She had been nervous about leaving behind everything she knew to live in Scotland, but the prospect of seeing her brother was too good to pass up. Now he couldn&#x2019;t even be here to pick her up? <br>No explanation other than it was an emergency. Dan could be thoughtless, but even he had seemed excited at her coming to Scotland. She couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder if the emergency had something to do with Dan&#x2019;s wife. They had been having some marital issues. <br>Cassie squared her shoulders. She could do this. Or so she thought. Finding the car was another obstacle. <br>Between the cold, her coat&#x2014;which was hardly enough to brace against the wind&#x2014;and her carry-on with wheels so old they didn&#x2019;t roll properly on the pavement, she never thought she&#x2019;d find the car. And when she was finally standing in front of it, all she could do was laugh. <br>It was either that or cry. <br>Cassie was bent over laughing so hard, tears threatened as she stared at what her brother thought was a vehicle but surely had to be a Hot Wheels car. <br>She fumbled with the keys to open the door and started laughing again at what constituted the backseat. &#x201c;I guess it&#x2019;s a good thing my luggage was lost, because there&#x2019;s no way I&#x2019;d fit it and myself inside.&#x201d; <br>Getting in the opposite side and realizing the car was a standard put another black mark in her brother&#x2019;s column. Not that she&#x2019;d say anything to him about it. He was giving her a place to stay when she had nowhere else to go. <br>At least the car had a GPS. Cassie hurried as fast as her numb fingers would allow her to input the address to pick up Duke&#x2014;another surprise, since she&#x2019;d no idea Dan owned a dog. <br>It took no time to get out of the airport, but she couldn&#x2019;t say the same for driving. Cassie had never been very good at driving stick shifts, and using her dumb hand was only making things worse. The sound of her grinding the gears could be heard all over Scotland. <br>Remembering to shift as well as staying on the correct side of the road had her already exhausted brain on overload by the time she reached the kennel. <br>And then she saw Duke. <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a dog,&#x201d; Cassie told the kennel worker in a strangled voice. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a freaking horse.&#x201d; <br>The teenager leading the black and white harlequin Great Dane out of the back room smiled. &#x201c;Duke is a big lad, but he&#x2019;s got himself a sweet disposition.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A good thing too, considering his size.&#x201d; <br>Cassie had never seen a Great Dane up close. She really hoped their reputation for &#x201c;gentle giant&#x201d; personas was true. Another catastrophe she couldn&#x2019;t take today. <br>&#x201c;Oh, shit,&#x201d; she said as she remembered the car. <br>Somehow the teenager got Duke in the front seat with the window down so the dog could poke his head out. <br>&#x201c;Dogs get carsick,&#x201d; he told Cassie, as if that explained everything. <br>&#x201c;I had no idea,&#x201d; she mumbled, and bent to look how Duke would have put his head had the window not been lowered. <br>She signed and climbed back into the car to input the address for Dan&#x2019;s house into the GPS. When she saw it would take her nearly four hours to reach the house, Cassie almost let the tears loose. <br>Instead, she gripped the wheel and looked at Duke, who regarded her with dark, solemn eyes while he panted. Even with the heater set on full blast, the cold still came in through the window. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure if I&#x2019;m ready for this,&#x201d; she said to Duke. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t slept in thirty-six hours, I&#x2019;m freezing, and I&#x2019;m driving a stick. On the wrong side of the road. This is a really shitty day, Duke.&#x201d; <br>In answer, he nudged his large head against her shoulder. She smiled and scratched him behind the ear. <br>Her morale fortified&#x2014;by a dog&#x2014;Cassie started the car and headed out on the M90 north toward Perth. For several hours the drive was fine, but then they left the road with shoulders for a narrower one that wound into the mountains. <br>Duke kept his head out the window and wore what Cassie was sure was a smile while she kept the car in the correct lanes. It was difficult not to look at the magnificent scenery, even in the dead of winter. <br>With the new year just beginning, Cassie viewed this not as a hiccup in her life, but as a new journey. It was a fresh start, and she intended to grasp it with both hands. <br>Suddenly there was a loud pop, and the car lurched on the road. Cassie sucked in a startled breath and tried to keep the wheel straight so as not to skid off the road and over the side of the mountain. <br>She slowed the car to a stop, shut it off, and sat with her eyes closed and her heart pounding like a drum. When she opened her eyes again, a glance showed her that even Duke had been wise and pulled his head back inside. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, boy,&#x201d; she said, and rubbed his giant head, her hands shaking from the adrenaline dump. &#x201c;Stay here while I go see what happened.&#x201d; <br>Cassie reached to open the door only to find it took her two tries before she could grasp the handle. She climbed out of the car and looked over the side of the mountain to the snow hundreds of yards below. <br>A walk around the car revealed that one of the tires was flat. She rubbed her hands together and blew on them for warmth. She was already trembling from the cold, and she&#x2019;d been outside for only a few seconds. <br>But she had faced far more daunting things in her life than a flat tire, and she wasn&#x2019;t about to fall apart now. Cassie lifted the back hatch of the Vauxhall Corsa and managed to find the spare tire. <br>Thank goodness she knew how to change a tire, or it would have been even longer. As it was, everything was taking twice as long because her fingers were so numb. <br>Just as she was fitting the spare on the car, it began to snow. Cassie gritted her teeth and kept working. An eternity later, the flat was replaced and she was back in the car. <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Duke, but I need to feel my hands again.&#x201d; <br>Cassie rolled up his window and turned the heater on full blast, with all the vents pointed to her. The car roared to life, and she hesitantly pulled back onto the road. <br>Dan had warned her about driving in the Highlands during winter. He needn&#x2019;t have bothered. Since Cassie had never driven in snow she was already apprehensive, and with the steep inclines, descents, and one-lane bridges, she was moving at a snail&#x2019;s pace. <br>And by the line of cars behind her, she was apparently the only one who felt the need to go slow. <br>As soon as Cassie was able, she pulled into a layby, which was Scots for &#x201c;passing lane,&#x201d; and allowed the cars to go by. She might not understand the way the British built their roadways, but she was very thankful for the laybys so others could go around her. <br>Another thing she never counted on was the sun setting so early. It was only four, and the sun was sinking faster than any sunset she&#x2019;d ever seen. Which meant she was not only driving in snow, in the mountains looking for a place she&#x2019;d never been, but she would also be doing it in the dark. <br>&#x201c;Lost luggage, Dan bailing on me, having to drive this toy car, getting Duke, a flat, and now snow and dark. Please, God, get me to the house in one piece,&#x201d; she prayed as she narrowed her eyes to see through the snow. <br>Duke whined softly, as if offering her comfort. <br>The roads became more winding and the curves tighter the farther north and deeper into the Highlands she drove. Her fingers ached from gripping the wheel so tightly. <br>Cars zoomed by her while she struggled to read the signs as the snow fell faster and faster. Twice she missed her turns only to have to double back and find them again. <br>The GPS was taking her farther and farther off what the Scots called main roadways to small two-lane roads with no stripes and what anyone in the States would call one-way roads. <br>&#x201c;Shit!&#x201d; she cried as she swerved to miss an oncoming car. <br>Cassie had to jerk the passenger-side wheels off the road to miss another car. It jostled Duke so badly, his head hit the roof of the car. <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Duke,&#x201d; she muttered when the dog gave a bark. <br>She&#x2019;d never felt so relieved as when she found the driveway to Dan&#x2019;s house. At least she didn&#x2019;t have to worry about oncoming cars anymore. As she drove down the long winding drive, she expected to see lights on in the house welcoming her. <br>But there was only darkness and stillness. <br>&#x201c;Dan, where are you?&#x201d; she asked. <br>She knew Dan and his wife were having some issues in their marriage, and it was just like Dan to be forgetful about things. But he had never forgotten <i>her</i> before. <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a first time for everything, I suppose.&#x201d; <br>Duke&#x2019;s whine only confirmed her suspicions. <br>She put the car in park and turned off the engine. Duke pawed at the door, letting her know he needed out. <br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Let me unlock the front door first.&#x201d; <br>Cassie unbuckled her seat belt and rushed for the door to the cottage. Dan had told her the key was in a black box near the door. What he hadn&#x2019;t told her was that she&#x2019;d need a code. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so going to hurt you, Dan. Badly. Very, very badly.&#x201d; <br>By this time, rain was beginning to mix with the snow. Duke&#x2019;s barking grew louder, and her only choice was to head back to the car and look through everything she had received from Dan to see if he&#x2019;d given her a code that she somehow missed. <br>As soon as she opened the car door, Duke jumped out and ran into the darkness. <br>&#x201c;Duke!&#x201d; she called, and tried to go after him. <br>Her foot hit a piece of ice and slipped out from underneath her. Cassie landed hard on her butt. She sat, the snow and rain seeping into her jeans, immobilized by the pain. <br>She had no idea how long she stayed there before she crawled back to the car, wincing at the agony of each movement. Her gloveless hands were now so frozen, she couldn&#x2019;t move them. It took her five attempts before she was able to unzip her purse and pull out her cell phone. <br>Getting any kind of Internet service was laughable, so she couldn&#x2019;t look through old e-mails. However, she was able to sift through the texts, but found nothing. <br>Cassie dialed her brother and listened to the call ring over and over again before finally going to voice mail. <br>The tears she&#x2019;d held back all day clogged her throat. She swallowed and laid her head on the steering wheel. She couldn&#x2019;t get the keys to let herself into the house, she&#x2019;d lost Duke, and she was most likely going to freeze to death in a toy car that offered no more than a sliver of warmth. <br>&#x201c;A fitting day for the beginning of my new life,&#x201d; she said as the first tear fell down her cheek. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Donna Grant</p><h2>The Big Money (USA)</h2><p>THE BIG MONEY completes John Dos Passos's three-volume "fable of America's materialistic success and moral decline" (American Heritage) and marks the end of "one of the most ambitious projects that an American novelist has ever undertaken" (Time).

A young composer, Siegfried; his estranged father, Freidrich, who held office under the Nazis and is once more making his way in public life, this time as a democratically elected burgomeister; Siegfried&#39;s uncle, Judejahn, an unrepentant former SS general; and Judejahn&#39;s renegade son, Adolf, who is preparing himself for the Catholic priesthood. The four men recount their separate experiences in music, bureaucracy, arms and religion - and, taken together, they personify the German soul. Death in Rome is a history book, a family book, a book about the battle over who gets to represent the authentic face of post-war Germany. It is a devastating and brilliant evocation of an entire nation.</p><p>Wolfgang Koeppen was born in 1906 and died ninety years later in Munich.

Holds wide appeal for research and browsing."--(starred) <i>Booklist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p>Grade 4-7-- Four more subject-surveys, in a handsome picture series, that will catch youthful imaginations with their wide-ranging selections of fascinating items, beautifully photographed. Topics are developed in two- to four-page groupings, with cross-references and an index--and browsers will find themselves caught and drawn into the flow. Music traces families of instruments and discusses the physics of sound with diagrams and cut-aways. From a 40,000-year-old bone whistle to components of an electric guitar, there are wonderful photos of ancient harps, bagpipes, pianos, and oriental instruments. Shell prods children to think about cases, whether egg, husk, or skull, but deals mostly with mollusks, urchins, and crustaceans. Early Humans shows early human fossils, and pictures selective topics (e.g., art, magic, tools, writing) for the human family up through the Iron Age. Examples come from Africa, Europe, the Americas, early China, the Near East, and Australia. Mammal explores that class in terms of its attributes, evolution, and variety of adapted forms. Photos of the bones of a seal's flipper, an elephant's foot, a panda's jaw, and a close-up of a whale's baleen are sure to appeal to children. While scale is infrequently given, relative sizes of objects are usually clear.

How are both the New Age Movement and the New World Order plans based on Plato&#39;s vision of re-establishing the Golden Age of Atlantis? According to New Age philosophies, the Atlanteans developed a highly advanced Utopian civilization based on secret knowledge brought by ancient astronauts. How are the gods of ancient civilizations related to these astronauts? And how are today&#39;s systems of the Illuminati, the Freemasons, the Theosophical Society, the Council on Foreign Relations, Communism, and modern Socialism connected to these ancient astronauts and the Ten Divisions of the Golden Age of Atlantis?

All across the globe, ordinary people spoke out, filled the streets and city squares, and took up arms in an attempt to win their freedom. <p>In this dramatic, page-turning history, Simon Hall takes the long view of the year's events&#x2015;putting them in their post-war context and looking toward their influence on the counterculture movements of the 1960s&#x2015;to tell the story of the year's epic, global struggles from the point of view of the freedom fighters, dissidents, and countless ordinary people who worked to overturn oppressive and authoritarian systems in order to build a brave new world. It was an epic contest.</p><p><em>1956</em> is the first narrative history of the year as a whole&#x2015;and the first to frame its tumultuous events as part of an interconnected, global story of revolution.</p> Illustrated with 16 pages of color and B&amp;W photographs</p><p>Simon Hall studied history at Cambridge University and held a Fox International Fellowship at Yale, before moving to the University of Leeds to teach American history. His previous books for the academic market include Peace and Freedom: The Civil Rights and Antiwar Movements in the 1960s; American Patriotism, American Protest: Social Movements Since the Sixties; and Rethinking the American Anti-War Movement. 1956 is his first trade book. He lives in England.&#x201c;Hall succeeds admirably in presenting 1956 as a year that belongs in the same revolutionary tradition as 1848 and 1968.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Financial Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A marvellous social history of that year.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Guardian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Hall deals with the remarkable year of 1956 on the British, American, and world fronts in this nicely written account of opposition to established authority (and resistance&#x2015;often brutal&#x2015;to that dissent). Hall does a workmanlike job in putting it all together. He sheds light on some vital events that took place in a very short period of time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Taking an ambitious, panoramic view of a single year, Hall examines major events in postwar Europe, America, Africa, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East. Contemporary newspaper reports give the author's month-by-month narrative a vivid, you-are-there quality. An impressive history of a year&#x2019;s political tensions, necessarily limited in focus but still sweeping and in-depth.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fast-moving and vivid. Hall is a fluent and unobtrusive narrator.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Independent</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>1956</em> is a study of revolution in action and in thinking. The parallels from continent to continent are nearly undeniable, and one can postulate from Simon&#x2019;s lively account that there was, if not a direct connection between all these happenings, certainly a notable ricochet effect.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Bookreporter</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Hall captures the collective drama of the year 1956. Switching between multiple developments, Hall provides a dramatic and immersive narrative of a tumultuous year of oppression, revolt, and reaction in a decade often considered bland and docile.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p><h2>The peoples of Kenya</h2><p>The Peoples of Kenya</p><p></p><h2>Unicorn School: First-Class Friends</h2><p>110 pages chapter book with illustrations; fantasy</p><p></p><h2>Where People Fly and Water Runs Uphill: Using Dreams to Tap the Wisdom of the Unconsious</h2><p>An expert in the field of dream study offers an accessible guide with an original perspective on how to capture and use dreams to understand and change life events. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>Taylor is an architect and research consultant based in York</p><h2>R.

She also describes her exhaustive primary source research involved in dating and identifying each image and investigating the story and genealogy of each subject. The array of seventy images is expansive and includes veterans, loyalists, Native Americans, African Americans, children who witnessed battles and aided soldiers, and women who nursed the wounded and even took up arms themselves. Although the faces that gaze at the reader are old and wizened, the stories they tell are of youthful bravery in the young days of the republic.</p> <p><em>The Last Muster </em>is a much-needed contribution to the history of the American Revolution, the early Republic, and the history of photography.

Jackson School of International Studies)</h2><p>From the late nineteenth century, Japan sought to incorporate the Korean Peninsula into its expanding empire. Japan took control of Korea in 1910 and ruled it until the end of World War II. During this colonial period, Japan advertised as a national goal the assimilation of Koreans into the Japanese state. It never achieved that goal. Mark Caprio here examines why Japan's assimilation efforts failed. Utilizing government documents, personal travel accounts, diaries, newspapers, and works of fiction, he uncovers plenty of evidence for the potential for assimilation but very few practical initiatives to implement the policy.<br><br>Japan's early history of colonial rule included tactics used with peoples such as the Ainu and Ryukyuan that tended more toward obliterating those cultures than to incorporating the people as equal Japanese citizens. Following the annexation of Taiwan in 1895, Japanese policymakers turned to European imperialist models, especially those of France and England, in developing strengthening its plan for assimilation policies. But, although Japanese used rhetoric that embraced assimilation, Japanese people themselves, from the top levels of government down, considered Koreans inferior and gave them few political rights. Segregation was built into everyday life. Japanese maintained separate communities in Korea, children were schooled in two separate and unequal systems, there was relatively limited intermarriage, and prejudice was ingrained. Under these circumstances, many Koreans resisted assimilation. By not actively promoting Korean-Japanese integration on the ground, Japan's rhetoric of assimilation remained just that.</p><p><b>Mark E. Caprio </b>is a professor in the Department of Intercultural Communications, Rikkyo University, Tokyo."The significance of addressing Japanese colonial rule in Korea in a broader comparative context cannot be exaggerated. Caprio had made a perceptive, innovative, and welcome contribution to expanding the scope of Japanese, Korean, and colonial studies."&#x2015;Marie Seong-Hak Kim, <i>Journal of Japanese Studies</i>, 37:2 2011<p>"His main purpose is to show, first how the colonial rulers of Korea tried to manage the Korean population with political, social, cultural, and linguistic approaches filled with enormous internal contradictions and sophistry. His second purpose is to show how segments of Korean society collaborated with Japanese designs. . . . Caprio has fleshed out the theme of assimilation with rich detail and nuance and thrown a fresh light on the complex nature of Japanese rule in Korea and its limitations. . ."&#x2015;<i>American Historical Review</i></p><p>"Mark Caprio's Japanese Assimilation Policies in Colonial Korea is an illuminating account.... The crux of Caprio's work is that Japan, like other colonial regimes, made hollow promises related to assimilation for rhetorical ends rather than as a political or social goal.... Japanese Assimilation Policies in Colonial Korea makes a twofold contribution to Korean and Japanese studies, as well as the more general field of colonial studies by first providing the global context for Japan's colonization of Korea and, second, examining the debate among Japanese in the public sphere regarding the assimilation of Korea. It is a worthwhile and quick read that I highly recommend."&#x2015;<i>Korean Studies</i></p><p>"Mark Caprio's recent book is a wonderful addition to the field of Korean and Japanese modern history. Its appearance is particularly timely as Japan and Korea ponder the meaning of the centennial anniversary of the 1910 annexation."&#x2015;<i>The Journal of Asian Studies</i></p><p>"For many years, the Japanese Empire remained hidden behind an island-centered story of the archipelago's 'modernization' and a Euro-centric bias in colonial studies. This can no longer be the case with the publication of Mark E. Caprio's new book."&#x2015;<i>Pacific Affairs</i></p><p>"Caprio argues that, despite the Japanese championing of full acceptance and equality of the Korean people as subjects of the Empire, Japanese policies towards the Koreans worked as contradictory roadblocks preventing complete assimilation. . . . Caprio examines his historical question through an intricate framework of definitions of colonization. . . Additionally, his organizational choice of beginning his work with an examination of European influences on Japanese colonial thought is both interesting and appropriate considering Japan's desire to emulate the West. . . . Ultimately, Caprio delivers an impressive, solidly researched work that adds a further dimension to the complex historical problem of Japanese expansion. ."&#x2015;<i>Journal of Military History</i></p><p>"Mark Caprio, as an American scholar of Korean history teaching at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, is uniquely qualified to avoid the nationalistic extremes of the debate over the right and wrong, and the impact, of Japanese colonial rule. Using both Korean and Japanese sources, and an impartial eye, he examines one aspect of the colonial period, Japan's official policy of welcoming the Korean people into the Japanese political and cultural community, and he comes up with some startling conclusions."&#x2015;<i>Monumenta Nipponica</i></p></p><h2>Engaging Unbelief: A Captivating Strategy from Augustine &amp; Aquinas</h2><p>How can we present the truth about Jesus to a world that rejects all truth claims as arbitrary? Can we find ways to engage in meaningful conversation without appearing arrogant or manipulative? Can we witness to the gospel without simply enlisting in the ongoing "culture wars"? <p>Curtis Chang has found a unique way to address these pressing questions of our age. He argues that similar challenges confronted Christians at two key moments in church history and stimulated creative responses by two monumental thinkers. Augustine (A.D. 413) faced a fragmenting society where pagans accused Christians of causing the mounting social ills afflicting Rome; Thomas Aquinas (A.D. 1259) pondered the disorienting Muslim challenge that provoked most medieval Christians to crusade rather than converse. Through a careful study of Augustine's City of God and Aquinas's Summa Contra Gentiles, Chang argues that both followed a brilliant rhetorical strategy for engaging unbelief. </p><p>Such a captivating strategy is critical in our cultural context where Christian witness seems as difficult as ever. Connecting these ancient writers to the contemporary analysis of thinkers like Alasdair MacIntyre, James Davison Hunter, Lesslie Newbigin and Stanley Hauerwas, Chang puts forth his own bold recommendations for Christian rhetoric in the twenty-first century. </p><p>This book will be of vital interest to a wide audience. Scholars will find a fresh reading of these important texts; pastors and teachers of evangelism and apologetics will discover crucial resources from our Christian past; and all thoughtful Christians seeking a faithful strategy for communicating the gospel will receive inspiration and hope for today. </p><p>"Engaging Unbelief maps a clear strategy for engaging our postmodern world. Chang is an excellent interpreter of Augustine and Aquinas, and his practical analysis of their two major apologetic works should not be missed by any Christian interested in broad cultural influence today. Thoughtful Christians will find much here to fuel and inform their passion for witness." Dr. Stephen A. Hayner, president of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA </p><p>"There is no question about it: this is a brilliant work. But it does not depend on sheer brilliance. It is massively and punctiliously researched. Mr. Chang's proposed 'rhetorical strategy' for our epoch, paradoxically harking back to Augustine and St. Thomas, presents a case to be energetically pondered by any thinking Christian believer in the odd intellectual milieu which we call contemporaneity."

She lives at the edge of the woods, where she knows, without a doubt, that she exists at the center of the world. What she doesn&#x2019;t know is that not far from her safe haven there is a river, and a world of such size and magnitude that she cannot even imagine it. One day, a burst of rain floods down on Whitefoot, lifting her in its currents and carrying her far from home. What happens next leads Whitefoot on a great adventure one in which she must encounter new experiences and challenges to her survival. The discovery of the universe around her, and her ability to survive within it, is a lesson that&#x2019;s sure to resonate with children and adults alike. Written by best-selling author, Wendell Berry, this beautiful volume is illustrated in fine detail with original drawings by acclaimed artist Davis Te Selle.</p><p>Starred Review. This small-format, gifty offering from an acclaimed author is not necessarily a children's book; the story it tells, in prose, will absorb adult admirers of literary craftsmanship as thoroughly as it does children. When Whitefoot the mouse is flooded out of her nest and carried downstream on a log&#x2014;and most of the book relates this journey&#x2014;she owes her survival to her innate skills. Every detail merits the closest observation: Her ears were listening into the slur and spatter around her. Her nose was intelligently sniffing....The voice in her mind was saying, 'Seeds! Seeds! Look around!' If Te Selle's densely detailed black-and-white drawings were any more realistic, readers would be able to see Whitefoot's tiny furry body breathing. Though everything that happens takes place an inch off the ground, Berry finds a heroic dimension to Whitefoot, and his gift is to make readers feel it, too.

He lives in Bozeman, Montana.Grade 6-8-- Out hunting, 13-year-old Josh watches in horror as his drunk father illegally shoots a mother bear, orphaning its cub. To prevent it from being seized (and probably destroyed) by the authorities, the boy heads for the mountains on his deceased brother's motorcycle with the cub and his dog, leaving a note that he won't return until there's a state law to protect the bears. His experiences alternate with the tense efforts of dedicated search and rescue teams to find him. Many people become involved in his mission and survival, from the governor to citizens who support Josh's crusade. The relationship between his parents, idyllic before the death of his brother and now jeopardized by his father's alcoholism, is sensitively wrought; however, the portrait of the fish-and-game administrator defending the rights of the hunter is darkly villainous, especially in comparison with the heroic environmental types. Because the length of the book may put off some readers, entice them with the jacket photo of the author with his 500-pound black bear. --Susan F.

Influenced by surrealism and Dada as well as constructivism, the technique was firmly established as an art form in the 1920s and 1930s through the work of artists such as John Heartfield, El Lissitzky, and Hannah Hoch. Today, a new generation of young artists and illustrators is rediscovering collage. Cutting Edges is a collection of current artistic work that unites unrelated elements to create something new. Although the artists also use the computer for the purpose of montage, most of the featured collages are made by hand and often include found objects. It is not only the addition of visual elements that is important to the work, but also their deliberate omission, deletion, and destruction. While the combination of very different materials is charmingly reminiscent of the past, the innovative work in Cutting Edges proves that a new era ofcollage has begun.

Kazan's theatrical r�sum� includes the original productions of <i>The Skin of Our Teeth</i>, <i>Death of a Salesman</i>, and four of Tennessee Williams's best dramas. For the screen, he created <i>Pinky</i>, <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>, <i>East of Eden</i>, <i>Baby Doll</i>, <i>A Face in the Crowd</i>, <i>On the Waterfront</i>, <i>Wild River</i>, and <i>America, America</i>. But during the red scare, the master director named names before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, ruining the careers of several of his contemporaries. <p> How could the man behind such thoughtful and sensitive masterpieces betray his friends? What is the relationship between an artist's personal life and his public vision? While Kazan spoke to these questions in his stunning, epic autobiography, <i>Elia Kazan: A Life</i>, this interview-based book offers new insight by focusing the conversation on the director's professional life. As Kazan responds to Jeff Young's probing queries, we vividly experience his uncompromising independence, determination, and strength of will. </p><p> Regarding the success of his most legendary film, Kazan says: </p><p> </p><blockquote>When I started <i>On the Waterfront</i>, I was what they call unbankable. Nobody would put up money for me because I had had a series of box office failures.... I had a hell of a time raising money, but I respond very well to difficulty. If somebody makes trouble for me, I come flailing out in every direction. One of my happiest moments was when I got the Academy Award for <i>On the Waterfront</i>.... It was especially rewarding because we had made something out of nothing.... All of a sudden no one cared what my politics were, that I was controversial, or difficult or that people were slamming me all the time. After <i>On the Waterfront</i>, I could do anything I wanted. That's Hollywood.</blockquote><p> This volume provides readers with an exquisite opportunity to examine the mind and work of a major artist--including details about Kazan's collaborations with Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, John Steinbeck, Marlon Brando, James Dean, Gregory Peck, Katharine Hepburn, and many others--as well as the chance to experience the creation of some of the century's most indelible works of art. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i></p><i>Kazan: The Master Director Discusses His Films</i> has been selected by the <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i> as one of the Best Books of 1999.</p><h2>My &#39;Dam Life: Three Years in Holland</h2><p>In <i>Sean &amp; David's Long Drive</i> he careered around Australia with his laconic pal David in a retro Ford Falcon. In <i>Drive Thru America</i> he and David cruised the States in a very uncool Chrysler Neon.<br><br>Now Australian humorist Sean Condon is married and living in Amsterdam - jobless, homeless, careless and Dave-less. In <i>My 'Dam Life</i> he casts a witty, watchful and wonderfully self-deprecating eye over his expat experience of laziness and leisure, dreams and destiny in the Venice of the North.<br><br>With his uncanny ability to seek out the absurd in everyday life, Sean finds plenty of targets in a city of hemp and high culture, canals and bicycles, idiosyncratic plumbing and internationally unrenowned cuisine. <i>My 'Dam Life</i> strikes a hilarious chord with anyone who has followed their dream of starting a new life abroad.<br></p><p>*Starred Review* Fans of offbeat travel literature rejoice! Condon, coauthor of <i>Sean and David's Long </i>Drive (1996) and <i>Drive thru America</i> (1998), returns with this hysterical, delightful, and (mostly) true account of his temporary residence in Amsterdam. The story begins when Condon's wife, a magazine editor, is transferred from the couple's home in Australia to the Netherlands; before they can settle in (finding a comfortable home in Amsterdam is next to impossible), the magazine folds, and our heroes are unemployed, fast approaching penniless, but determined to make a go of it in their new country. Condon's wife, Sally, takes a job in a theater box office, while he joins an up-and-coming (they hope) advertising agency and, later, accepts a series of peculiar writing assignments. He also, out of a combination of desperation and whimsy, applies for an assortment of oddball jobs, including scheduling programs for a Dutch television station. Chuckles abound. Stylistically and philosophically, Condon is as close to Bill Bryson as it's possible to be. He mixes fascinating facts with hilarious humor, peppers the book with an assortment of wild and wonderful supporting characters (Francis Ford Coppola and Monica Lewinsky, if you can believe it, make cameo appearances here), and keeps us thoroughly in stitches from beginning to end. This one's an absolute must-read. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Launched in 1997, Cassini entered orbit around Saturn in summer 2004. Its formidable payload included the Huygens probe, which successfully parachuted down through Titan's atmosphere in early 2005, all the while transmitting images and data--and scientists were startled by what they saw. One of those researchers was Lorenz, who gives an insider's account of the scientific community's first close encounter with an alien landscape of liquid methane seas and turbulent orange skies. Amid the challenges and frayed nerves, new discoveries are made, including methane monsoons, equatorial sand seas, and Titan's polar hood. Lorenz and Mitton describe Titan as a world strikingly like Earth and tell how Titan may hold clues to the origins of life on our own planet and possibly to its presence on others.</p><br><br><p>Generously illustrated with many stunning images, <i>Titan Unveiled</i> is essential reading for anyone interested in space exploration, planetary science, or astronomy.</p></p><p><br><p>"A great book for anyone wanting to know what it's like to be on the front lines of a mission to perhaps the most fascinating planetary body in the solar system. Lorenz and Mitton bring home the fact that planetary exploration is not a faceless enterprise done by anonymous men in white coats, but a personal adventure carried along by real people with real charisma, real quirks, and real lives."<b>--Mike Brown, California Institute of Technology</b><br></p><br><p>"This book could hardly be more timely. Titan is inarguably one of the most intriguing objects in the solar system, and the wealth of new information revealed by the successful Cassini-Huygens mission is revolutionizing our knowledge of this mysterious moon. Lorenz and Mitton are well qualified for the project, and have written a very compelling book."<b>--Edwin L. Turner, Princeton University</b><br></p><br><p>"This is the first trade book that looks at the mission results in a comprehensive way. It gives a summary of our knowledge of Titan prior to the probe, describes the history of the probe project, and discusses the results from the mission. I am not aware of any books like this one."<b>--Christopher P. McKay, NASA Ames Research Center</b><br></p><br><p>"<i>Titan Unveiled</i> is an authentic and lively insider's account of one of the grand enterprises in modern space exploration. The authors present a compelling human story of interplanetary exploration, rich in detail and strong on science.

Vollmann</b><br><br>In his nonfiction, William T. Vollmann has won acclaim as a singular voice tackling some of the most important issues of our age, from poverty to violence to the dark soul of American imperialism as it has played out on the U.S./Mexico border. Now, Vollmann turns to a topic that will define the generations to come--the factors and human actions that have led to global warming. Vollmann begins <i>No Immediate Danger</i>, the first volume of <i>Carbon Ideologies</i>, by examining and quantifying the many causes of climate change, from industrial manufacturing and agricultural practices to fossil fuel extraction, economic demand for electric power, and the justifiable yearning of people all over the world to live in comfort. Turning to nuclear power first, Vollmann then recounts multiple visits that he made at significant personal risk over the course of seven years to the contaminated no-go zones and sad ghost towns of Fukushima, Japan, beginning shortly after the tsunami and reactor meltdowns of 2011. Equipped first only with a dosimeter and then with a scintillation counter, he measured radiation and interviewed tsunami victims, nuclear evacuees, anti-nuclear organizers and pro-nuclear utility workers.<br><br>Featuring Vollmann's signature wide learning, sardonic wit, and encyclopedic research,<i> No Immediate Danger</i>, whose title co-opts the reassuring mantra of official Japanese energy experts, builds up a powerful, sobering picture of the ongoing nightmare of Fukushima.</p><p>William T. Vollmann is the author of ten novels, including <i>Europe Central</i>, which won the National Book Award. He has also written four collections of stories, including <i>The Atlas</i>, which won the PEN Center USA West Award for Fiction, a memoir, and six works of nonfiction, including <i>Rising Up and Rising Down</i> and <i>Imperial</i>, both of which were finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award. He is the recipient of a Whiting Writers Award and the Strauss Living Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. His journalism and fiction have been published in<i> The New Yorker, Harpers, Esquire, Granta</i>, and many other publications.When We Kept the Lights On<br><br><i>We all have in us the ghosts of long-vanished things, of fallen cities and marvelous machines.</i><br><i>Gene Wolfe, 1982<br><br></i>Someday, perhaps not long from now, the inhabitants of a hotter, more dangerous and biologically diminished planet than the one on which I lived may wonder what you and I were thinking, or whether we thought at all. This book is for them.<br><br>When I read another embrittled document predicting the disappearance of bison from the American Plains, my melancholy is untainted by urgency. Captive bison do survive, but the great herds have been gone since 1884. And as I write this book about coal, oil, natural gas and atomic power, I do my best to look as will the future upon the world in which I lived&#x2014;namely, as surely, safely vanished. Nothing can be done to save it; therefore, nothing need be done. Hence this little book scrapes by without offering solutions. There were none; we had none. All the same, it may not be uninteresting to learn what went on in the minds of buffalo hunters, Indian killers, coal miners, freeway drivers, homeowners and nuclear engineers.<br><br>In the time when I lived, it was still possible to meet Americans who disbelieved in global warming, although the ones I knew became shyer and rarer in about 2013. In 2016, they helped elect Donald Trump President, upon which their various carbon ideologies naturally came roaring back.<br><br>&#x201c;We sure need a good Sierra snowpack this year,&#x201d; said a contractor friend of mine. &#x201c;Skiing was lousy last year and the year before. If we can only get some snow, that will make those global warming people shut up.&#x201d;&#x2014;That was just before Christmas. Come spring, the snowpack was 6% of what we had been calling normal. But why not call California a special case? Up in Washington the snowpack was a full 16% of what it should have been; and by May, &#x201c;seeing things happen at this time of year we just have never seen before,&#x201d; Governor Inslee declared a &#x201c;statewide drought emergency.&#x201d;&#x2014;Fortunately,my contractor friend was vindicated, and those global warming people utterly foiled, for after a long dry year, the subsequent winter blew flurry-rich,and by January the Sierra snow level had reached 115%!<br><br>February turned unseasonably warm. The leftwing hoaxers got impudent again. As for the skeptics, they took strength in the fact that carbon forecasters&nbsp;of other stripes had been wrong before, in token of which I quote from my grandfather&#x2019;s <i>Mechanical Engineers&#x2019; Handbook</i>, copyright 1958: Petroleum would soon run out! <i>The peak of production in the United States should come about 1965</i>. . . <i>World shortage of petroleum may be expected to begin about 1960</i>.&#x2014; If only!&#x2014; As for coal, in predicting that American production would reach its height in about 1975 the <i>Handbook</i> was not far wrong, but it anticipated that a world shortage of <i>total world fossil fuels</i>. . . <i>would be noticeable</i> around that same year, which is precisely when a build-your-own-alternative-style-house primer warned us all: <i>A Federal Power Commission staff study, released in January of 1975, concluded that natural gas production from the forty-eight contiguous states has reached its peak and will decline for the indefinite future</i>.&#x2014;We were all on theverge of getting cold!&#x2014;But in 1993 the National Coal Association announced that &#x201c;at present rates of use&#x201d; our coal reserves <i>can be expected to last nearly 250 years. There are about 1,000 tons of recoverable coal for every man, woman and child in the United States. </i>Then came fracking, which afforded gas enough to toast us in our planetary oven.<br><br>In each of these dull and distant comedies, we got condemned to future deprivation, and then the diagnosis brightened! (I myself got cynical; I didn&#x2019;t care; I chalked it up to financial manipulation.) In 1999 my atlas advised me that oil might last another 40 years if we were lucky. And in 2015, as I sat beside the automatic gas fire, writing <i>Carbon Ideologies</i>, Iran announced intentions to increase her gas output by 40% in the next five years, while coal prices fell farther; oil prices had just decreased again: There remained enough fossil fuels to choke us all! So why not deal sharply with pessimists, or refrain from dealing with them at all? Mr. Jonathan Lee, whose company rented out supertankers, felt <i>as excited as a rookie because you are seeing history change before your&nbsp;eyes! </i>China and India meanwhile began seizing <i>a bargain opportunity to top off their petroleum reserves</i>. The prior errors of prophecy proved that no one knew anything about anything; therefore, climate change was the merest hot air.<br><br>Not far from the disbelievers dwelled those who couldn&#x2019;t be bothered about &#x201c;an ecosystem somewhere.&#x201d; In 2016 a kindly barber told me: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really think none about it, although I have to say that when I see people pick up cigarette butts from the sidewalk I appreciate their caring, and people that care about the earth, I mean, that&#x2019;s nice, and when I think about the polar bears losing their land, I do feel touched about that, because I care a lot about animals.&#x201d; For him, an ecosystem was something to watch on television while he ate takeout pizza. He was a decent fellow who had never been consulted by the carbon vendors&#x2014;whose systems of extraction and delivery had long since become invisibly ubiquitous.<br><br>In 2014 my friend Philip, a cheerful, hardworking realtor in his early 40s, allowed that global warming might exist, but that it was natural and &#x201c;evolutionary&#x201d;; the human race had little to do with it. For years we had drunk together and listened to each other, so I asked him to tell me more. &#x201c;Why should I concentrateon anything that stresses me out?&#x201d; he demanded, and when I saw that the subject might dent his cheerfulness, I changed it.<br><br>Kindred sorts reassured me that our new weather was &#x201c;natural&#x201d; and cyclical,and therefore required no action. Indeed, precious little action was taken. <i>For more than 40 years, Homer City</i> Generating Station in Pennsylvania <i>has spewed sulfur dioxide from two of its three units completely unchecked</i>,. . . <i>because it is largely exempt from federal air pollution laws. . . Last year, the facility released 114,245 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than all of the power plants in neighboring New York combined</i>. This pollutant was both a killer of many organisms and a dangerous &#x201c;precursor&#x201d; gas with unpredictable effects on the climate. In 2011,the Environmental Protection Agency finally demanded that Homer City cleanup. After threatening <i>immediate and devastating consequences</i> and losing a lawsuit,the utility found a way to comply&#x2014;without even raising its electricity rates. When I read this tale in the newspaper, my first emotion was happy astonishment that mitigation had proved so practicable&#x2014;after which I felt all the more amazed that Big Coal kept digging in its heels against reducing harmful&nbsp;emissions elsewhere&#x2014;and was allowed to do so&#x2014;while Big Oil and Big Frack behaved much the same. (As for Big Nuke, its mantra, as we shall see, was: <i>No immediate danger</i>.)&#x2014; In 2017, a fellow who had repeatedly sued the EPA was appointed to run the agency. Well, after all, who gave a damn about some old ecosystem somewhere? (A newspaper item: <b>Pounded Again, Coastal Town May Consider a Retreat</b>. <i>Just repairing and repairing the sea walls&#x2014;it isn&#x2019;t a permanent solution with the ocean coming ever closer to us</i>. Those words used to be exotic, back when I was alive.) Who could say whether <i>somewhere</i> might be here? That ecosystem&#x2019;s peculiarities had always lain beyond our ken. Although odorless methane might be accompanied by the scent of crude oil, and while carbon dioxide, that <i>colorless gas with a faintly pungent odor and acid taste</i>, sometimes heralded itself in jet trails and smokestack-clouds, both of these quickly vanished into our all-accepting sky. Then what? As a West Virginian pastor told me (you will meet him in the coal section): &#x201c;Here you do see the smokestacks and you know that they do put off the smoke and everything, but it seems to me that the earth is so large and there are so many trees and everything that how could manmade equipment put up enough smoke to make a difference?&#x201d; His question was absolutely reasonable. Answering it would have required the help of scientists, instruments and historical records. Even then, <i>causation</i> could never be proved. All one might hope to establish was plausible correlation with predictive value. Most of us were non-correlators; to us the clashing claims felt wearisome, complicated, inscrutable. It took me all my life merely to understand aspects of myself&#x2014;and why shouldn&#x2019;t the latest scaremongers be as wrong as the Cassandras of&nbsp; &#x201c;peak oil&#x201d;? In Bangladesh I met coal mine workers and even a labor union leader who had never heard of global warming; of course they asserted that there was &#x201c;no alternative&#x201d; to coal extraction. Indeed, they proved their own point.<br><br>I remember another courteous old West Virginian who had just been speaking cogently about his childhood, his coal miner father and the decline of coal extraction in Appalachia; he grew vaguer when I requested his views on climate change: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s got something to do with the situation on TV&#x201d;&#x2014;meaning that he had seen television footage of weather-related disasters, and supposed that global warming might be part of the cause. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s part of the pollution problem,&#x201d; he allowed. Then he added, and I failed to follow his logic, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why the EPA is doing what they are, stepping beyond their authority, I think, in a lotof ways.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think coal contributes to global warming?&#x201d;<br><br>He reassured me: &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve got technology now that can cut all the pollution out.&#x201d;<br><br>Had it only been so!&#x2014; In fact it was so <i>a little bit</i>, as Homer City unwillingly&nbsp;proved&#x2014;but our captains of fuel and electricity resisted even that little for all they were worth, which was plenty.<br><br>Anyhow, that good old man, who cannot be faulted for the incompleteness of his knowledge on greenhouse gases; and the disdainers of somewhere-nowhere ecosystems, the gloom-and-doom handwringers like me, the climate change deniers and the consoling weather-cycle asserters, we were all outnumbered by ordinary practical folks for whom cheap energy and a paycheck incarnated all relevance. One fellow wrote in to the newspaper: <i>My son works in the coalfields ofsouthern West Virginia[;] he supports my two grandchildren by mining the coal that keeps the lights on in America</i>&#x2014;this last phrase being often used by my nation&#x2019;s carbon ideologues. <i>So I know first hand the importance of winning the war on coal that Obama declared five years ago</i>. Whether it was truly Obama who started it, who our enemy was, and whether America&#x2019;s lights might beneficially be dimmed here and there, failed to encumber him. The maintenance of his two grandchildren trumped other arguments; their needs caused him to <i>know firsthand</i> the small selfish thing that he knew. I will not celebrate him, but I decline to blame him, either. Why should his kin go hungry? (You in our future can go hungry instead; after all, we don&#x2019;t even know you.)<br><br>In <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>&#x2019;s &#x201c;Notable &amp; Quotable&#x201d; section, a so-called &#x201c;environmental writer&#x201d; enlarged his argument into a carbon eulogy:<br><br>In 1971 China derived 40 percent of its energy from renewables. Since then, it has powered its incredible growth almost exclusively on heavily polluting coal, lifting a historic 680 million people out of poverty. . . A recent analysis from the Centre for Global Development shows that $10 billion invested in such renewables [as solar energy] would help lift 20 million people in Africa out of poverty. It sounds impressive, until you learn that if this sum was spent on gas electrification it would lift 90 million people out of poverty. So in choosing to spend that $10 billion on renewables, we deliberately end up choosing to leave more than 70 million people in darkness and poverty.<br><br>In other words, back when I lived, some of us believed that heavily polluting coal could somehow lift people out of poverty without impoverishing us in anymore fundamental way. We believed that because it was convenient to believe it. So we kept the lights on.</p><h2>Climbers guide to Montana</h2><p>Climbers Guide To Montana by Pat Caffrey Here are 1150 Montana peaks scattered through 34 mountain ranges of the state, each classed as to difficulty, from easy walks and scrambles to the most challenging and difficult rock work.

But in this new book Chris Paton, the Northern-Irish-born author of the best-selling Tracing Your Family History on the Internet, shows that not only has a great deal of information survived, it is also increasingly being made available online. <br><br>Thanks to the pioneering efforts of the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, the National Archives of Ireland, organizations such as FindmyPast Ireland, Ancestry.co.uk and RootsIreland, and the massive volunteer genealogical community, more and more of Ireland&#x2019;s historical resources are accessible from afar. <br><br>As well as exploring the various categories of records that the family historian can turn to, Chris Paton illustrates their use with fascinating case studies. He fully explores the online records available from both the north and the south from the earliest times to the present day.

Drawing on a wealth of first-hand experience-the Mowats lived in the outport community for five years-Claire Mowat has written a fictional memoir that beautifully recreates an almost vanished world.

His mission is to bring the planet back into the fold of an evolving galactic civilization, but to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own culture and prejudices and those that he encounters. On a planet where people are of no gender--or both--this is a broad gulf indeed. The inventiveness and delicacy with which Le Guin portrays her alien world are not only unusual and inspiring, they are fundamental to almost all decent science fiction that has been written since. In fact, reading Le Guin again may cause the eye to narrow somewhat disapprovingly at the younger generation: what new ground are they breaking that is not already explored here with greater skill and acumen? It cannot be said, however, that this is a rollicking good story. Le Guin takes a lot of time to explore her characters, the world of her creation, and the philosophical themes that arise.<p> If there were a canon of classic science fiction, <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> would be included without debate. Certainly, no science fiction bookshelf may be said to be complete without it. But the real question: is it fun to read? It is science fiction of an earlier time, a time that has not worn particularly well in the genre. <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> was a groundbreaking book in 1969, a time when, like the rest of the arts, science fiction was awakening to new dimensions in both society and literature. But the first excursions out of the pulp tradition are sometimes difficult to reread with much enjoyment. Rereading <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i>, decades after its publication, one feels that those who chose it for the Hugo and Nebula awards were right to do so, for it truly does stand out as one of the great books of that era. It is immensely rich in timeless wisdom and insight.</p><p> <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> is science fiction for the thinking reader, and should be read attentively in order to properly savor the depth of insight and the subtleties of plot and character. It is one of those pleasures that requires a little investment at the beginning, but pays back tenfold with the joy of raw imagination that resonates through the subsequent 30 years of science fiction storytelling. Not only is the bookshelf incomplete without owning it, so is the reader without having read it. <i>--L.

Meticulous visual analysis is paired with close readings of medieval texts in examining a series of important relief sculptures from northern and central Italy dating from the twelfth through the fourteenth centuries, including the impressive sculptural programs at the cathedrals of Modena and Ferrara, and the pulpits by Giovanni and Nicola Pisano at Pisa and Pistoia. Demonstrating that medieval sculptors orchestrated the reception of their intended religious and political messages through the careful manipulation of points of view and architectural space, Christopher R. Lakey argues that medieval practice was well informed by visual theory and that the concepts that led to the codification of linear perspective by Renaissance painters had in fact been in use by sculptors for hundreds of years.</p><p>Demonstrating the influence of optical science on medieval relief sculpture, this groundbreaking book reveals that the concepts that informed the codification of perspective by Renaissance painters were already being employed by sculptors centuries earlier.<p><b>Christopher R.

Coghlan recounts earlier adventures in Patagonia when, taking time off from his job as a schoolteacher in Buenos Aires in the late 1970s, he and Jenny explored the region of southern Argentina and Chile over three successive summers. This time, as they negotiate the labyrinth of channels and inlets around snow-covered Fireland, he reflects on voyages of past explorers: Magellan, Cook, Darwin, and others.

The youngest of four children, highly intelligent, well read, and a gifted athlete, he had been involved in a murder at he age of 14, lived as a Rastafarian, and was immersed in the drug culture. Kincaid&#39;s poetic and often shockingly frank account of Devon&#39;s life is also the story of their family on the island of Antigua. Her chronicle of a life ended too early, speaks volumes about the difficult truths at the heart of all families. 4 cassettes.</p><p>Compassion only occasionally lightens the grim tone of Jamaica Kincaid's searing account of her younger brother Devon's 1996 death from AIDS. As in novels such as <i>Annie John</i>, Kincaid is ruthlessly honest about her ambivalence toward the impoverished Caribbean nation from which she fled, her restrictive family, and the culture that imprisoned Devon. That honesty, which includes chilling detachment from her brother's suffering, is sometimes alienating. But art has its own justifications. The bitter clarity of Kincaid's prose and the tangled, undeniably human feelings it lucidly dissects are justification enough.<p><b>Jamaica Kincaid's </b>books include <i>At the Bottom of the River</i>,<i> Annie John</i>, <i>A Small Place</i>, <i>Lucy</i>, and <i>The Autobiography of My Mother</i>.

In this updated edition, Francis Turner introduces exciting new theoretical systems that have gained importance since the 1980s, including Aboriginal theory, Narrative, Hypnosis, Constructivism, and Empowerment theory. Twenty chapters from the previous edition have been completely revised and expanded, to reflect the influence of new ideas and clinical experience in social work practice. An exceptionally strong group of distinguished contributors to past editions and writers new to this volume together examine the full range of therapeutic approaches - including psychoanalysis, ego psychology, cognitive, crisis intervention, client-centered theory, feminist theory, meditation, transactional analysis, systems theory, task-centered social work, and neurolinguistics.<br>Social Work Treatment makes the range of theories upon which current practice is built fully available, providing professionals with ready access to the theoretical diversity and richness that is the mark of contemporary social work practice. It enables social work students at all levels - bachelor, masters and doctoral - to learn and integrate ongoing theoretical developments in the field, which ultimately ensures a client's optimum service.</p><p>Francis J. Turner is now Professor Emeritus at Wilfrid Laurier University.In the fifth edition of this seminal text, Francis Turner has once again gathered information useful for the educator, student, and practitioner alike. Each of the expertly written thirty-eight chapters provides a rich resource filled with theory-based explanations, and a framework for the subsequent concepts and strategies that lead to intervention success. In each of the approaches to practice, one unified message is heard throughout the chapter, clearly calling for an open and flexible approach to practice that takes into account all aspects of the person&#39;s internal and external environment. Solving problem behaviors is never simple and providing an interlocking framework that allows for choice in selecting theoretical perspectives opens the door to consistent, comprehensive, efficient, and effective service delivery. Sophia F. Dziegielewski, PhD, Professor, School of Social Work, University of Cincinnati This much-needed update to Turner&#39;s classic and comprehensive text on social work treatment theories includes nine new theories that have become influential in social work practice since the fourth edition published in 1996. It is essential that experienced practitioners as well as those new to the field be conversant with the theories and approaches that are shaping social work practice today. Turner&#39;s new edition, authored by recognized scholars and experienced clinicians, brings together all of the relevant social work treatment theories in today&#39;s postmodern world, making it easy for readers to become informed and to begin applying the theories in their practice.

In killing-grounds whose names are indelibly imprinted on 20th-century memory, German machine-guns&#x2014;manned by troops who had sat out the storm of shellfire in deep dugouts&#x2014;inflicted terrible losses on the British infantry.

She'd spent the past several months putting together the details for her brother's wedding and it was wonderful to see it all come together so perfectly.<br><br>In less than two hours, Chase and his fianc�e, Chloe, would be saying "I do" beneath rose-covered arches with three hundred guests looking on. The Napa Valley vineyard owned by her oldest brother, Marcus, was not only the perfect backdrop for the wedding, but was also where Chase and Chloe had first met and fallen in love.<br><br>The catering staff Sophie had hired was busy in the on-site kitchen. The florist was putting the finishing touches on the flowers that ran up both sides of the aisle and the beautiful bouquets at the center of each of the tables in the reception area. The weather was perfect with blue skies and a few puffy white clouds lazily floating by. The vineyards were bursting with green leaves and budding grapes, and the mustard flowers between the rows of vines were a stunning burst of golden color all across the seemingly endless hills of grapevines.<br><br>The bride and the other bridesmaids were already in the guesthouse having their hair and makeup done. Sophie should have been there getting ready with them half an hour ago, but she'd wanted to first make sure that everything outside was perfect. Which was why she was still standing out in the vineyard wearing jeans tucked into boots, a long blue sweater and a hat over hair she hadn't bothered with that morning because she knew the stylist would take care of it for her.<br><br>Sophie was a librarian, not a wedding planner, but she'd leaped at the chance to help plan Chase's wedding, and it had been so much fun. Well, apart from all those meetings with&#x2014;<br><br>"Hey, Nice, looking good."<br><br>Every muscle in Sophie's body tensed at hearing the low drawl from behind her.<br><br><em>Jake McCann.</em><br><br>Her brother Zach's closest friend...and the object of twenty years of her unrequited love.<br><br>Of course, not once in those twenty years had she ever been anything more to him than Zach's little sister. What's more, she knew darn well that she wasn't "looking good" right then in clothes she'd put on to move furniture and heavy containers of flowers all morning.<br><br>Barely stifling a frustrated sigh, she replied, "My name is Sophie, not Nice," without turning to face him. She'd reminded him of this at least a hundred times over the years, but he still persisted in calling her by her nickname.<br><br>It was one thing when her brothers called her Nice...and it was another entirely when Jake said it. Especially when, in her secret dreams, she was naughty and wild and the woman he couldn't believe he'd lived without for so long.<br><br>She felt him move closer, his innate heat searing her even from several feet away. She'd always been overly attuned to him, instantly alert to his presence in a room. As a little girl, she'd made excuses to hang out with her older brothers just to be near Jake, keeping extra quiet so no one would remember she was there while they played in the tree fort or shot pool in the basement while making off-color jokes that she didn't understand until she was a great deal older.<br><br>The urge to turn and drink him in, to lose herself in the spark of wicked in his chocolate-brown eyes, was so strong she almost gave in. Of course, she knew every inch of Jake's face by heart, having spent most of her childhood staring at him when she didn't think he was looking. His jaw was square and his nose had a couple of bumps on it that she knew were from fights he'd been in.<br><br>So instead of looking at him, she forced herself to keep her gaze trained on the outdoor seating area, watching the florists make final adjustments to the arrangements and the caterers rush trays of food in from their vans to Marcus's industrial-size kitchen. Regardless of what she actually felt for Jake, Sophie's pride insisted that she do her best to act as if she didn't care one way or another if he was there or not.<br><br>"Hard to believe the day has finally come." He paused, and she could hear the humor mixed with a faint disdain in his voice as he finished, "A Sullivan is actually taking the plunge."<br><br>Sophie was known as the clearheaded, soft-spoken one in the family, the one who always thought things through before taking action. She'd never been prone to outbursts or to giving in to crazy inner urgings. That was her twin sister Lo-ri's territory, which was why Lori's nickname was Naughty and Sophie's was Nice. But Sophie rarely felt levelheaded anymore around Jake.<br><br>How could she when her heart always beat too fast at the thought of what it would feel like to be in his arms...or because he was making her angry with some macho comment? Usually both at the same time. Just as he was doing right now. He was utterly infuriating but so darn desirable that even though she knew she had to be crazy for wanting him the way she did, she'd never been able to stop the way she felt.<br><br>Hating how out of control he made her feel, her fingers curled into fists as she lost the battle with acting aloof and whirled around to face him.<br><br>Unfortunately for her traitorous hormones, Jake was more gorgeous than ever in his tuxedo. His crisp white dress shirt opened up just enough at the neck for her to see the dark hair curling up at the vee of his chest. His tattoos were covered up, but just knowing they were hidden behind a thin layer of fabric sent a kick of forbidden desire rushing through her. God, what she wouldn't give to see his tattoos up close, to have hours to run her fingers over his naked skin and study the ink imprinted into his skin.<br><br>"Chase and Chloe are in love," she told him in a sharp voice made even sharper by her disappointment with herself for not being even the slightest bit unaffected by Jake's good looks. "Their wedding is going to be beautiful and perfect and incredibly romantic."<br><br>It was even more beautiful and perfect and romantic that Chloe was pregnant and absolutely glowing. Sophie couldn't wait to babysit, to endlessly spoil her niece or nephew. Jake's mouth moved up into a half smile at her emphatic statement. "It's going to be one hell of a party, at least."<br><br><em>What was wrong with him?</em> Sophie wondered for what had to be the thousandth time in twenty years. How could he look at a lifetime of love and only see the party?<br><br>Then again, given the fact that he blew through women at a shockingly fast rate, it wasn't hard to guess that he was one of those imbeciles who didn't believe in love. A rich, good-looking guy like Jake McCann would just be in it for the sex. She should know better than to give him even five minutes of her time. And yet...if it were that easy, if love was that rational, then she likely would have found another man to fall in love with years ago.<br><br>Unfortunately, when it came to her feelings for Jake, rational had absolutely nothing to do with them, and never had.<br><br>Even worse, thinking about sex and Jake at the same time always made her go hot all over, and now was no different. Sophie was neither a virgin nor a prude, despite what people might otherwise assume about librarians. On the contrary, if people knew just how well-read she was on the subject of sex, they would likely be shocked. Especially Jake.<br><br>Wouldn't it be something to shock Jake, who clearly thought he had written the book on seduction?<br><br>Darn it, by now she should know better than to let her fantasies run away with her where Jake was concerned, even if her body had stupidly fallen in lust with him from the first stirring of teenage hormones. And still, she couldn't help but breathe in his scent, a faint hint of hops and something she'd never been able to categorize beyond <em>night</em> and <em>darkness.</em><br><br>She moved to straighten an already perfectly straight chair. "I checked over the bar setup earlier and it looks like everything is in place." She'd planned on hiring a professional bar service for the wedding, but Jake had insisted on covering that aspect of the wedding himself. He owned a chain of Irish pubs, and despite the fact that he was incredibly successful with his businesses, she hadn't been quite sure how he'd pull off a bar at a formal wedding.<br><br>Now that she'd seen what he'd done, she grudgingly had to admit, "You've done a good job with it. A really good job."<br><br>She could feel his dark eyes on her as he said, "So have you, with this entire wedding." Again he gave her that half smile that made her stomach do flip-flops. "You sure I can't hire you to run my pubs? I could always use someone like you to whip the things into even better shape."<br><br>A burst of pleasure at his compliments shot through her, warming her all over. That was the problem with Jake. Even when she was irritated with him, even though he'd never return her feelings for him in a million, billion years, she couldn't help but be charmed by him. Sophie and every other woman on the planet, it often seemed.<br><br>Still, knowing she'd never forgive herself if she melted into a gooey puddle of lust in the middle of Marcus's vineyard, she simply told him, "I'd miss my books too much, thanks."<br><br>All her life, Sophie had had stacks of books in every room and she'd recently embraced the digital age and gotten an e-reader that fit in her purse. She'd gone to Stanford University and come out with a combined degree in English literature and Library Science that she'd put together herself with the help of an adviser who loved books just as much as she did. As soon as she'd graduated from college, she'd applied to work for the San Francisco Public Library. She knew she could have made much more money working for a university library, or applying her research and cataloging skills to one of the high-tech startups throughout the Bay Area, but she'd always wanted to be a librarian. Even if her apartment was on the small side and she'd never be rich, she hadn't regretted her decision for a second.<br><br>Knowing that prolonging her close proximity to Jake in this uberromantic setting would only mess with her head, she said, "I'd better get over to the guesthouse." But just as she was turning to go, a sudden gust of wind whipped her baseball cap off her head.<br><br>Jake reached out and caught it by the brim before she even had time to react. "Got it."<br><br>He moved in front of her and slid a lock of dark hair that had caught on her mouth back under the hat as he settled it into place. Her cheek tingled from the gentle brush of skin on skin and she nervously licked her lips. She couldn't remember the last time he'd touched her. It wasn't that he wasn't an affectionate man, it was just that he'd always seemed to steer clear of touching <em>her.</em><br><br>His hands stilled on the brim of her hat, his dark eyes turning almost jet-black as his gaze held on her mouth. Neither of them moved for several moments, but then, suddenly, he was stepping back from her, the slightly cool wine-country air pushing in where his heat had been just seconds before.<br><br>"You might want to tighten it down so it doesn't blow off again," he told her before quickly scanning her outfit with a frown. "Aren't you one of Chloe's maids of honor? What are you still doing wearing that?" Still working to catch her breath from the shock of his touch, it took far longer than it should have for her to register his question. She couldn't miss the mocking tone, however.<br><br>Months ago, when Jake had volunteered to run the bar at Chase and Chloe's wedding, she'd impulsively decided to teach him a lesson about his arrogance, along with the way he insisted on continuing to look at her as little more than a child, rather than a fully grown woman. She'd planned to make him want her, to somehow figure out a way to make him desperate with longing...before she scorned him, leaving him high and dry for the first time in his life.<br><br>But had she made good on those big plans to attract and then reject Jake in the past four months?<br><br><em>Ha!</em><br><br>"Yes, I am," she finally replied, her words a hard snap of breath and teeth. "Everyone else is getting dressed, but I needed to check on a few final things first."<br><br>The perfect planes of his face shifted again from frown to scowl, before settling back into indifference. "Now that you know everything is perfect, you'd better go get pretty, then, shouldn't you, princess?"<br><br>Jake's harsh words landed with a hard thud between them. She didn't know if he'd intended to hurt her with the implication that it would take some time, along with a good amount of effort, to pretty her up...but whether or not that had been his intent, that was exactly what he'd just done.<br><br>A few minutes ago she'd felt proud of what she'd accomplished with Chase and Chloe's wedding. Now, that pride was all but erased by the way Jake looked at her and clearly found her so wanting, so utterly devoid of female allure. Because even though she knew better than to care, even though she knew better than to give him the power to hurt her, a handful of his careless words did more damage than anything else ever could have.<br><br></p><h2>The Holmes Manuscript (The Lost Dutchman Mine of Jacob Waltz, Part 2)</h2><p>This is a very readable journal of the Holmes&#x2019; family hunt for this famous lost mine.

Peter's carefree spirit and nature is what I adored as a child and long for now as an adult. And these are the feelings I tried to convey into my rendition of the boy-who-would-not-grow-up. </p><p> In working on an image for the American jacket of this authorized sequel, I went through many designs trying to capture the spirit of the 100-year-old character while making him intriguing to the readers of today. This, of course, is much easier said than done. </p><p> Many of us have an idea of what Peter Pan should look like based on stage plays, movies, and the myriad of illustrated books, but in actuality both J. M. Barrie and Geraldine McCaughrean describe very few of his physical features. This opens up a lot of room for visual interpretation for an illustrator, however anything too severe in redesign would lead to confusion of identifying who this iconic and (dare I say) mythic character is. So I tried to breathe some new life into his appearance, but still remain faithful to the Peter Pan we all know and love. </p><p> <i>--Tony DiTerlizzi</i> </p></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><b>Geraldine McCaughrean</b> is an award-winning author who has written more than 130 books and plays for children and adults.

Complementary to NHS hospitals, they present a face that is welcoming, risk-taking, aesthetic and life-affirming; and with their commitment to the other arts, including landscape, they bring in the full panoply of constructive means.<br> <br>Maggie's Centres are a new mixed building type for healing that have different roots in the past. As Jencks and Heathcote show, this hybrid quality is a response to the condition of cancer; its myriad causes and bewildering number of possible therapies. The 'architecture of hope' is this new emergent hybrid genre, consisting of various metaphors that correspond in kind to the many different types of cancer and their various treatments. <br> <br> The Centres have been designed by celebrity architects, including Richard Murphy, Page and Park, Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Richard Rogers, Richard MacCormac, the late Kisho Kurokawa, Piers Gough, Wilkinson Eyre and Rem Koolhaas. Additional Centres are being planned by Norman Foster &amp; Partners, Thomas Heatherwick and Steven Holl.<br> <br>The Centres are committed first to helping cancer sufferers help themselves, to inspiring carers to care more, and secondly to architecture. It is the arts and building, important allies in the perennial struggle with cancer, that lead to the 'architecture of hope'. As people walk into a centre after a diagnosis, or enervating treatment, often disoriented and lacking in self-confidence, they enter another world which acknowledges their importance and a basic condition that may become prevalent: living with cancer and not losing hope.</p><p>This is a new edition of The Architecture of Hope, first published in 2010, but now completely updated and redesigned with new material throughout, and additional essays about the role of art at Maggie's and about the gardens and landscaping. There is also a new section showcasing the way architecture students have responded to the Maggie's brief.</p></p><p>Charles Jencks is the author of several best-selling books on architecture. He divides his time between lecturing, writing and designing in the USA, in the UK and in Europe.<p>"What you all have created, in terms of architecture, is a community statement to patients and carers that <em>Your Life Matters</em>.

Together, the great writer and the great city came of age and confronted triumph and tragedy. Triumph came when Shakespeare&#x2019;s company, the Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men, opened the Globe playhouse on Bankside in 1599, under the patronage of Queen Elizabeth I. Tragedy touched the lives of many of his contemporaries, from fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe to the disgraced Earl of Essex, while London struggled against the ever-present threat of riots, rebellions and outbreaks of plague.<br> <br><i>Globe</i> takes readers on a sweeping tour of London through Shakespeare&#x2019;s life and work, as Catharine Arnold recounts in fascinating detail how acting came of age. We learn about James Burbage, founder of the original Theatre in Shoreditch, who carried timbers across the Thames to build the Globe among the bear-gardens and brothels of Bankside, and of the terrible night in 1613 when the theatre caught fire during a performance of King Henry VIII. Rebuilt, the Globe continued to stand as a monument to Shakespeare&#x2019;s genius until 1642 when it was destroyed on the orders of Oliver Cromwell. And finally we learn how 300 years later, Shakespeare&#x2019;s Globe opened once more upon the Bankside, to great acclaim, rising like a phoenix from the flames.<br> <br>Arnold has created a vivid portrait of Shakespeare and his London from the bard&#x2019;s own plays and contemporary sources, combining a novelist&#x2019;s eye for detail with a historian&#x2019;s grasp of his unique contribution to the development of the English theatre. This is a definitive and compelling portrait of Shakespeare, London, the man and the myth.</p><p>Catharine Arnold read English at Cambridge and holds a further degree in psychology. A journalist, academic and popular historian, her previous books include the novel Lost Time, winner of a Betty Trask award, and the acclaimed Necropolis: London and Its Dead, Bedlam and City ofSin, the first three volumes of her &#39;London&#39; series. She lives in Nottingham.<p>Arnold is at her best in comparing the modern theatre with the gross conditions in which Shakespeare&#x2019;s contemporaries watched proceedings.&#x2019;</p><p>The Times</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Arnold offers a tour of Elizabethan and Jacobean London, showing how a confluence of events allowed the theaters to flourish. Four stars.&#x201d;</p><p>Margaret Sankey -&nbsp;Educator</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Globe is a delightful read from start to finish. From an imagined scene that brings to life late Tudor London, Arnold takes us into a fascinating history of the London theatre scene, and Shakespeare's place in it. There is never a dull moment.&#x201d;</p><p>Nicki Markus</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Full of interesting details, the book does not neglect other playwrights of the time or &nbsp;Shakespeare's fellows in the Lord Chamberlain's Men. Accessible instead of ponderous and scholarly, you'll learn so much about how theater worked in Elizabethan England, information that sheds light on the plays as they were perceived by the people of the time.&#x201d;</p><p>Janet Perry &#x2013; Reviewer</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>"A previous stranger to Catharine Arnold&#x2019;s work, I feel grateful to have been introduced to her through a subject that is so richly rewarding, both historically and artistically. The inextricable link between London&#x2019;s chaotic, complex past and the life of Britain&#x2019;s greatest poet is explored with exceptional enthusiasm. This handiwork is a feast for imagination and edification, weaving scores of facts with extracts from the works of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, to create as complete a picture as possible of a fascinating time in a place that remains enchanting. The result is a necessity for any Shakespeare aficionado.&nbsp;"</em><br> <strong>The Lady</strong></p></p><h2>Terrariums &amp; Kokedama</h2><p>Terrariums, aeriums and kokedama (Japanese for &#39;moss ball&#39;) have exploded in popularity and making them at home is surprisingly easy and a wonderful way to keep plants in our homes.

In that moment of exaltation, writes Robert Edgar Riegel, "flags waved, bands played, and orators prophesied the flowering of the West under the beneficent influence of the steam locomotive. For once the orators were right. An epoch was marked. Twenty-five years earlier the musical whistle of the locomotive was as yet unheard in the United States. Twenty-five years later steel tracks spanned the continent from New York to San Francisco."</p><p>In this account of the railroad conquest of the United States, the author is primarily concerned with the western phase of the story. He follows the Iron Horse west through Indian trouble, labor difficulties, civil war, and farmer disillusionment to the completion of the western railroad net.

Renowned historian Edwin Gaustad chronicles Jefferson&#39;s intellectual growth, paying particular attention both to Jefferson&#39;s private struggle to come to grips with his own faith and to his public role as champion of religious liberty. This volume is must reading for anyone interested in the religious life of one of America&#39;s most significant figures.</p><p>Gaustad has again demonstrated his mastery of American religious history with this elegantly crafted and incisively argued study of Jefferson&#39;s religion. Of course, in telling so well the story of Jefferson&#39;s engagement with religious issues, he has also given us an important piece of American nation building.Edwin S. Gaustad (1923&#x2013;2011) was Professor Emeritus of History and Religious Studies at the University of California, Riverside. He also taught at Shorter College, the University of Redlands, Baylor University, and Auburn University. He received a B.A. from Baylor University and a M.A. and a Ph.D. from Brown University.

Eitan's blithe, classy cut-paper illustrations maintain the electric charge of America's First Lady of Song's delivery and match her sophistication. One character is black, the other Anglo, true to the nursery song's broad appeal. No simple interpretation though, A-tisket reflects the style of a jazz classic. The exuberance of the two children (one losing a basket, one finding it) is enhanced by its contrast with their static urban landscape. The youngsters' clear energy is another nod to Fitzgerald's breezy style. Starting with the endpapers on which baskets and "that little girlie" dance fancifully on an impressionistic depiction of the song's score, it's motion and more motion. Characters are all arms and legs and dance propelled by Eitan's mixed-media, gouache, computer art blast. The book suggests a variety of lively uses for storytime programs and home fun. The reader assumes the role of Fitzgerald's band leader: "Was it red?" and the audience, like her band members, replies: "No, no, no, no." The expectation for children's picture books illustrating songs used to be no more than a series of images supporting the lyrics' literal meaning. This title joins the newer, more sophisticated wave of interpretations like Chris Raschka's Simple Gifts (Holt, 1998) after the Shaker hymn, and Woody Guthrie's Howdi Do (Candlewick, 2000), illustrated by Vladimir Radunsky. Like A-tisket, they evoke the spirit and life inside the songs.<br><i>Liza Graybill, Worcester Public Library, MA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Solar Express</h2><p><p><i>Solar Express</i>, the thrilling, new, hard science fiction novel from <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author L.

Sheila Miyoshi Jager presents the first comprehensive history of this misunderstood war, one that risks involving the world&#x2019;s superpowers&#x2015;again. Her sweeping narrative ranges from the middle of the Second World War&#x2015;when Korean independence was fiercely debated between Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill&#x2015;to the present day, as North Korea, with China&#x2019;s aid, stockpiles nuclear weapons while starving its people. At the center of this conflict is an ongoing struggle between North and South Korea for the mantle of Korean legitimacy, a &#x201c;brother&#x2019;s war,&#x201d; which continues to fuel tensions on the Korean peninsula and the region. <p>Drawing from newly available diplomatic archives in China, South Korea, and the former Soviet Union, Jager analyzes top-level military strategy. She brings to life the bitter struggles of the postwar period and shows how the conflict between the two Koreas has continued to evolve to the present, with important and tragic consequences for the region and the world. Her portraits of the many fascinating characters that populate this history&#x2015;Truman, MacArthur, Kim Il Sung, Mao, Stalin, and Park Chung Hee&#x2015;reveal the complexities of the Korean War and the repercussions this conflict has had on lives of many individuals, statesmen, soldiers, and ordinary people, including the millions of hungry North Koreans for whom daily existence continues to be a nightmarish struggle.</p><p>The most accessible, up-to date, and balanced account yet written, illustrated with dozens of astonishing photographs and maps, <em>Brothers at War</em> will become the definitive chronicle of the struggle&#x2019;s origins and aftermath and its global impact for years to come.</p> 95 illustrations; 16 maps</p><p>Sheila Miyoshi Jager earned her PhD in anthropology from the University of Chicago.

In Zinky Boys journalist Svetlana Alexievich gives voice to the tragic history of the Afghanistan War. What emerges is a story that is shocking in its brutality and revelatory in its similarities to the American experience in Vietnam - a resemblance that Larry Heinemann describes movingly in his introduction to the book, providing American readers with an often uncomfortably intimate connection to a war that may have seemed very remote to us. The Soviet dead were shipped back in sealed zinc coffins (hence the term "Zinky Boys"), while the state denied the very existence of the conflict; even today the radically altered Soviet society continues to reject the memory of the "Soviet Vietnam."<br>Creating controversy and outrage when it was first published in the USSR - it was called by reviewers there a "slanderous piece of fantasy" and part of a "hysterical chorus of malign attacks" - Zinky Boys presents the candid and affecting testimony of the officers and grunts, nurses and prostitutes, mothers, sons, and daughters who describe the war and its lasting effects.

He lives with his wife, kindred spirit, and fellow musician-the two have a steady weekly gig-MaryAnn Harris.Grade 8 Up-Mythic fiction is at its best in this anthology of stories of memorable heroines, rooted not in a secondary world but in an urban environment. The author introduces each selection, providing insight and interesting biographical information. The subject of two stories is a 16-year-old vampire named Apples who receives "the Gift" from a stranger during a Bryan Adams concert. She hopes to "turn" her sister Cassie when she is older, if she agrees, so they can live together forever. Poking fun at the television version of a teenage vampire, the heroine offers a more pragmatic view of her lot in life as she avenges evil doings in her neighborhood. In the section "Bordertown," where magic and reality coexist, an elf named Manda saves the life of a Harley-riding black man who is the neighborhood peacekeeper in a city rife with prejudice and violence. Elements of Robin Hood, Merlin, Native American mythology, and Celtic music weave through each story. Some of the heroines are humans who briefly tiptoe into a magical realm or are skeptical about its existence. De Lint's characters are often lonely and intelligent misfits whose self-discovery triumphs over plot. Described as "urban fantasy," these stories represent a hybrid genre for readers who only want one arm through the door into another world.<br><i>Vicki Reutter, Cazenovia High School, NY</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Gospel Side of Elvis</h2><p>Gospel music was a significant part of not only who Elvis became as a man, but as an artist as well.

Now, in a beautifully written novel that is already breaking records in his native Ireland, Colfer introduces readers to a lovable but troubled heroine, who has been given the opportunity for a special kind of redemption. Meg Finn is in trouble-unearthly trouble. Cast out of her home by her stepfather after her mother&#39;s death, Meg is a wanderer, a troublemaker. But after her latest stunt, finding a place to sleep is the least of her worries. Belch, her partner in crime, has gotten her involved in the attempted robbery of an elderly man, Lowrie McCall. And things go horribly wrong. After an accidental explosion, Meg&#39;s spirit is flung into limbo, and a race begins between the demonic and the divine to win her soul. Irreverent, hilarious, and touchingly hopeful, The Wish List takes readers on a journey of second chances, where joy is found in the most unexpected places.</p><p>Meg Finn has led a miserable life. First, her mum died, saddling her with a useless, nasty stepfather. Then, angry and alone, Meg found herself committing acts of petty crime with dim-witted hood Belch Brennan. Finally, just as she was about to go straight to honor her sainted mum&#x2019;s memory, Belch went and got them both killed as they attempted to rob crabby old Lowrie McCall. And if that wasn&#x2019;t bad enough, now St. Peter and Beelzebub can&#x2019;t decide which way Meg is supposed to go. She is one in a million: a soul perfectly balanced between good and evil. Now Meg&#x2019;s got to go back and somehow tip the scales UP--the further, the better! To earn her wings, Meg&#x2019;s been assigned to help the last person she tried to hurt (Lowrie McCall) who has a wish list of wrong choices that he wants to make right. But Beelzebub can&#x2019;t stand the thought of a bad soul going good. So he sends back the soul of powerfully stupid Belch, (who went straight down without stopping) to muck things up for Meg and Lowrie. But Meg&#x2019;s got smarts on her side and more than just a few tricks up her insubstantial sleeve...<p> At times, best-selling author Eoin Colfer&#x2019;s <i>Wish List</i> reads like a head-on collision between <i>Dawson&#x2019;s Creek</i> and <i>Touched by an Angel.</i> But rabid fans of the <i>Artemis Fowl</i> books won&#x2019;t notice or care.

He's got a wish list of life regrets to be set right and only so much time to do it.

The concept could have made this a handy one-volume ready reference book ideal for public and school libraries. Unfortunately, many diagrams are awkardly laid out or very nearly bury information in the gutter of the book. Since so many details about each topic are found in the tiny italic print of very long picture captions, readers need to refer back and forth between illustrations and lettered or numbered notes to comprehend the subject under discussion. Layouts with more open spacing might have made this easier, but the designers' need to compress this presentation into a two-page format clearly made such spacing difficult. Nevertheless, the book is a comprehensive interdisciplinary reference geared for teens and adults who have little knowledge of earth and natural science.

March 1977. Soft Cover. Book Condition: Fine. Illustrated By Kevin Reilly (illustrator). First Trade Paperback. 5 1/4&#34; x 8&#34;. A complete guide to the legends, history, languages and peoples of Middle Earth. Contains almost every known fact, name, &#34;foreign&#34; word, date and etymological allusion, together with an explanation of the various Elvish writing systems, and with maps, charts and genealogical tables developed by the compiler. Light edge wear. Some creases on the spine.</p><p>Between 1932 and 1953, Professor John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, of Oxford, England, translated four volumes compiled by the renowned Hobbits Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, written during the Third Age of Middle Earth, far longer ago than the Celtic, Germanic and Icelandic manuscripts Professor Tolkien was used to deciphering. The result was<br>The Hobbit, and readers have never been<br>the same since.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1954, seventeen years after The Hobbit first appeared, its sequel, The Lord of the Rings was published, and it became the centerpiece of Tolkien's work. The Ring Epic covers approximately ten thousand years, and contains a vast amount of information as well as a huge variety of words and names which Tolkien translated from the Elvish and Mannish tongues. THE TOLKIEN COMPANION is an impressive endeavor to guide one through the world of Middle Earth, compiling every fact, name, word, and date from all the works into one comprehensive and accessible volume.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in one source, is the High History of the Elven peoples. The origins of Morgoth the Enemy is clarified, as is his Fall, and the subsequent rise to power of Sauron the Great, Lord of the Rings. The heroic epic of how the Free Peoples--Elves, Men, Ents, Dwarves, and Hobbits--survived against the Peril of the Ancient World is meticulously detailed. And a guide to the various Elvish writing systems, together with explanatory maps, charts, even genealogical tables, bring the remarkable genius of Tolkien and the unforgettable world and wonder of Middle Earth to life with focus and accuracy. Presented in alphabetical order for quick and easy reference, THE TOLKIEN COMPANION is an indispensable accompaniment for anyone who embarks on the reading journey of a lifetime.J. E. A.

Immediately recognisable by its daring yet subtle use of colour and brushmark to evoke the spirit of place, his work is to be found in public and private collections throughout the world. In this, the definitive study of Hitchens&#39; life and work now issued in a new, revised edition, Peter Khoroche draws on the painter&#39;s published writings, correspondence and conversation to create a critical reappraisal of Hitchens&#39; theory and practice. He surveys the entire oeuvre (still-lifes, flower pieces, nudes, interiors and large-scale murals besides the landscapes), a huge legacy of work spanning sixty years, and charts the journey from conventional beginnings to &#39;figurative abstraction&#39;. A new selection of over 100 colour images provide a retrospective exhibition covering Hitchens&#39; whole career. These illustrations, examples of his best and most characteristic painting in all genres, demonstrate the artist&#39;s outstanding talents and reinforce his standing as a key figure in the history of British art.</p><p>Peter Khoroche wrote the catalogue for an exhibition of Hitchens&#39; paintings (Serpentine Gallery, London and tour 1989/90) and for an exhibition of Ben Nicholson&#39;s drawings and painted reliefs (Kettle&#39;s Yard, Cambridge and tour 2002/3). He is also the author of Ben Nicholson: Drawings and Painted Reliefs (Lund Humphries, 2002).English painter Hitchens (1893-1979) translated his intense communion with nature into a "visual music" employing rhythm, counterpoint and echo as unifying devices. In landscapes, room interiors and still lifes he melded the discoveries of Braque and Cezanne into his own pictorial language. His sensuous, Matisse-like nudes and figure studies balance abstraction and realism. His murals--carefully orchestrated symphonies of color--create kaleidoscopic patterns of endless movement. In this extensively illustrated monograph, Khoroche, author of a catalogue of Hitchens's work, argues that the easy flow of paint and romantic emotionality belie "a painter of remarkable intellectual discipline." This is the first full-length study of an artist who resolutely went his own way, defying the trends. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bringers of Hell (6) (Tau Ceti Agenda)</h2><p>BOOK #6&nbsp;IN THE BEST-SELLING TAU CETI AGENDA SERIES, SEQUEL TO&nbsp;<i>KILL BEFORE DYING</i>.

She&#x2019;d fast-tracked him onto his SLC and had been pleased to see her decision justified when Command had given him his third hook.

They were short NCOs and, as she&#x2019;d pointed out, she&#x2019;d be wasted in a staff position. Although the Corps reserved the right to send her wherever the hell it pleased, both points were inarguable and she&#x2019;d been sent home.

I very much doubt it.&#x201d; Search protocols and calming announcements from the Elder Races be damned. &#x201c;Not unless it wants to be found.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great.&#x201d;</p><p>She had to admire the dryness of his delivery. He&#x2019;d deserved that promotion. &#x201c;Not really.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What does it want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It told me it was collecting data.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Studying us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So it seems.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No idea. We may never know.&#x201d; Little pieces of plastic were ubiquitous throughout Confederation space. The alien could be a part of any of them. It could be any of them. It could mimic other materials, and while the parts they&#x2019;d most recently been in contact with had been gray, Big Yellow proved rather conclusively that didn&#x2019;t have to be the case. The handrail on the beltway could be recording data for the alien&#x2014;as the alien&#x2014;while she passed. Torin, by career choice and disposition more paranoid than most, had made a conscious decision not to think about that.</p><p>&#x201c;It could make us all forget it was ever here,&#x201d; Hollice pointed out, his voice fraying a bit around the edges.</p><p>&#x201c;Not all of us, Hollice.&#x201d;</p><p>He turned, stared at her for a moment, and smiled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. It can&#x2019;t mess with your head.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Took a look inside and was scared off. It wants to get to Sh&#x2019;quo Company, it&#x2019;ll have to get through me.&#x201d; Which was both the truth and complete bullshit since she had no more way of stopping the alien, singly or collectively, than she had of convincing the Navy that a straight line was the shortest distance between two points. But it was bullshit Hollice needed to hear and bullshit he needed to repeat to his squad. Or maybe it was the part of the statement that was the truth he needed to repeat. Whatever worked.</p><p>Technically, it hadn&#x2019;t messed with her head. Hadn&#x2019;t adjusted her memories of the escape pod the way it had adjusted the memories of nearly everyone else who&#x2019;d been involved in the exploration of Big Yellow.</p><p>Hadn&#x2019;t and couldn&#x2019;t were two totally different things.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The shortage of NCOs meant that Torin had only to put in a request to the station sysop to have her old quarters reassigned. The recon mission to Big Yellow had been a temporary posting, but the promotion before traveling to Ventris to brief Command on the Silsviss had destroyed the certainty of a round-trip ticket&#x2014;integrating an aggressive reptilian species into the Corps would take decades, and she&#x2019;d essentially been responsible for their willingness to join. That made her, if not an expert on the species, someone whose opinion Command intended to exploit. Fortunately, new information from the Marines stationed at the embassy on Silsviss had pushed her experience out toward the edge of the target. Some of those Marines were trained xenopsychologists rather than a noncom with good instincts and a willingness to kick ass when required, and, more importantly, none of them had been expected to kill a senior officer.</p><p>Torin suspected a few people were concerned because they still weren&#x2019;t sure if she&#x2019;d have gone through with it had General Morris&#x2019; sacrifice actually been necessary. She supposed it didn&#x2019;t help that when asked directly she&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;As it wasn&#x2019;t necessary, I guess we&#x2019;ll never know.&#x201d;</p><p>Which was the absolute truth; it wasn&#x2019;t something anyone could know until it happened&#x2014;no matter what they believed themselves capable of.</p><p>Her willingness to hack Major Svensson&#x2019;s arm off with an ax hadn&#x2019;t reassured anyone.</p><p>When she dialed the door open, her quarters looked just as she remembered them, right down to the Silsviss skull hanging on the wall over her entertainment unit. Weird. When she&#x2019;d left for Ventris, she&#x2019;d put everything she wasn&#x2019;t taking with her into station storage.</p><p>&#x201c;Messages?&#x201d; she asked as the door slid shut behind her.</p><p>She&#x2019;d verbalized, so the station did the same. &#x201c;One message to Gunnery Sergeant Kerr from Staff Sergeant Greg Reghubir. As follows: &#x201c;Welcome back, Gunny. We figured the last thing you&#x2019;d need to do was sort your crap out, so we did it for you. Lance Corporal Ressk says you need stronger encryptions on your storage unit.&#x201d; Greg sounded matter-of-fact, but Torin would have bet hard currency that he&#x2019;d changed his own unit&#x2019;s setting immediately after he saw what Ressk could do with an eight-digit code. &#x201c;Twenty-thirty tonight in the SRM; don&#x2019;t be late, or we&#x2019;ll start without you.&#x201d;</p><p>Torin patted the skull fondly as she passed on her way to the shower. It was good to be home.</p><p>* * *</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a lot of action out on the edge of the sector. Long-range sensors have picked up Susumi portals here, here, and here.&#x201d; Captain Rose touched three points on the star field currently mapped out on the briefing room&#x2019;s HMU and frowned at the resulting red lights. &#x201c;Navy swears they&#x2019;re not responsible.&#x201d;</p><p>Second Lieutenant Jarret&#x2019;s lavender eyes darkened as light receptors opened to give him a better look at the map. &#x201c;Civilians, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>The captain sighed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s always possible some dumbass corporation or university has decided to scout the perimeter&#x2014;those types always think they&#x2019;re invincible until they find out they aren&#x2019;t and we have to pull their butts out of the fire&#x2014;but I don&#x2019;t honestly think so. We usually get some kind of a heads up just so we&#x2019;re available to pull those butts out of the fire, and, so far, no one&#x2019;s admitting they&#x2019;ve gone visiting.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about independents, sir?&#x201d; Second Lieutenant Heerik was brand new, on her first posting with none of her enthusiasm blunted, and more than one of Sh&#x2019;quo Company&#x2019;s officers and NCOs bent over their slates and hid a smile at the intensity of the Krai lieutenant&#x2019;s question.</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of independents did you have in mind, Lieutenant?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, maybe civilian salvage operators.&#x201d; Her nose ridges flared. &#x201c;It was a CSO who found Big Yellow.&#x201d;</p><p>And Torin felt the attention of the room shift to her.</p><p>&#x201c;Gunnery Sergeant Kerr?&#x201d;</p><p>Torin had served with the captain long enough to know he was amused her relationship&#x2014;or whatever the hell it was she had with Craig Ryder&#x2014;had made it into the briefing. Although his reaction was subtle enough, the odds were good no one else could see it. &#x201c;CSO Craig Ryder found Big Yellow because of a small error in his Susumi calculations.&#x201d; She waited out the murmur of reaction. Small errors in Susumi calculations were usually fatal errors. &#x201c;Spaced as they are. . .&#x201d; She nodded toward the lights on the map. &#x201c;. . . these portals are clearly deliberate. Salvage operators follow rather than lead, and there&#x2019;s nothing happening out there. No debris, no reason for them to be deliberately jumping that way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unless there&#x2019;s something happening out there,&#x201d; Lieutenant Jarret said thoughtfully.</p><p>&#x201c;Unless,&#x201d; Captain Rose agreed. &#x201c;Which is why the Navy has sent the Hardyr out to have a look around. Captain Treis came out of Susumi space here. . .&#x201d; Another touch on the star map illuminated a fourth portal, this one green. &#x201c;. . . and is proceeding with due caution to this system, ST7/45T2. . .&#x201d; One last touch. &#x201c;. . . here.&#x201d; The system was equidistant from all three red portals.</p><p>&#x201c;How long is due caution expected to take, sir?&#x201d; Lieutenant Joriyl wondered.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll likely be headed Coreward before it happens, Lieutenant.&#x201d;</p><p>Her pale orange eyes darkened as she smiled. &#x201c;And not a moment too soon, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Lieutenant di&#x2019;Pin Joriyl was the senior platoon officer. With her heading into Ventris on course that meant. . .</p><p>Torin blinked as she realized that meant Second Lieutenant di&#x2019;Ka Jarret would be senior. The voice of reason and experience for Second Lieutenant Heerik and an even greener second lieutenant to be named later. It hadn&#x2019;t been quite a year since a very green Jarret had been tossed into a stew of giant lizards and diplomacy gone bugfuk, and suddenly Torin felt old. Life was moving just a little too fast of late.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Treis will keep Recar&#x2019;ta Station informed, Recar&#x2019;ta will keep Battalion informed, and&#x2014;if we&#x2019;re really lucky&#x2014;Battalion will let us know what the hell is going on before they ship us out to deal with it. Platoons are nearly at full strength for the first time in a long time, so let&#x2019;s make sure everyone&#x2019;s geared up and ready to go.&#x201d; The star field flicked off. Captain Rose swept his gaze around the room, then nodded once. &#x201c;Details have been downloaded to your slates; get out there and get ready to save the galaxy&#x2019;s ass yet again. Gunnery Sergeant Kerr, remain behind.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Torin stood as the officers and NCOs made their way out of the small briefing room, Jarret throwing her a distinct we&#x2019;ll get together later before turning his attention back to Heerik, who continued talking about the best responses to possible foothold situations, unaware of expressions exchanged nearly a meter over her head. Torin had been Jarret&#x2019;s staff sergeant for that snafu of a giant lizard diplomacy trip, and she&#x2019;d been impressed by the way the young officer had handled himself&#x2014;both independently and under her guidance. If he stayed beyond his first contract, he&#x2019;d be a credit to the Corps, and she&#x2019;d be happy to serve under him again.</p><p>When the room emptied, she followed Captain Rose and First Sergeant Siaosi Tutone through the door to the captain&#x2019;s office.</p><p>&#x201c;Opinion, Gunny?&#x201d; he asked, dropping into the chair behind his desk. Captain Rose&#x2019;s voice had always seemed about three sizes too big for his body, but here, in the relative privacy of his office, he sounded tired. No, weary. Tired of all the crap that came from being a fair distance down the military food chain.</p><p>Or maybe Torin was reading too much into it.</p><p>&#x201c;I think three Susumi points definitely indicates the Others are interested in something in that end of the Sector,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;I think the lack of any significant attempt to hide their presence means they&#x2019;re coming through in force. I think the Navy should have sent more ships because if the Others get that force on the ground we&#x2019;re looking at Battalion moving the whole Ground Combat Team out in response. And I think that the music selection in the Senior Ranks&#x2019; Mess changed for the worse while I was gone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That would be my selection,&#x201d; the first sergeant pointed out. His voice was as deep as the captain&#x2019;s although less incongruous, rumbling up as it did from the depth of an enormous barrel chest. Torin was tall, but Tutone topped her by a head and a half&#x2014;taller even than most di&#x2019;Taykan&#x2014;and proportionately broad. His hands were enormous, and muscle strained against the confines of his Class Cs.</p><p>&#x201c;Good choice, First. It&#x2019;s past time I broadened my musical tastes,&#x201d; Torin added, although she wasn&#x2019;t sure whether she was aiming for more or for less sincerity.</p><p>Tutone grinned, teeth flashing white against the rich mahogany of his skin.</p><p>Captain Rose leaned back in his chair and smiled as well. &#x201c;Welcome home, Gunny. It&#x2019;s good to have you back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, sir. It&#x2019;s good to be back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Recar&#x2019;ta Station agrees with your analysis, by the way. When the orders come down, they&#x2019;ll come down for the entire GCT. That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re here, specifically here with Sh&#x2019;quo Company when we don&#x2019;t generally rate a gunny. Aman&#x2019;s short, and she&#x2019;s not reupping. Unless we deploy in the next tenday, that&#x2019;ll leave Jura&#x2019;s platoon with a shiny new second lieutenant and Heerik, who&#x2019;s almost as shiny, with a green staff sergeant. We&#x2019;ll move the new staff sergeant in under Jarret, since he&#x2019;s got a whole year of experience. . .&#x201d; Pale eyes rolled, although for the most part he kept the sarcasm from his voice. &#x201c;. . . but that&#x2019;s going to leave the company scrambling for experience among the officers and senior NCOs.

He lives in the Scottish Borders and writes for the Daily Telegraph and the Scotsman.Another fictionalized biography from British veteran Massie of an ancient great (Let the Emperor Speak, 1987, etc.)--though, here, the Roman emperor Tiberius sounds more like a US president complaining about Congress than an imperial swashbuckler. In the purported-to-be real memoirs of Tiberius--given to Massie by a mysterious Italian count--Tiberius, a stiff-necked prig, describes his gradual and reluctant rise to power, with accompanying nuggets of obvious political sagacity thrown in to enhance his already sizable gravitas. As his mother, Livia, tells him when he is forced by his imperial stepfather Augustus to marry the imperial daughter, free-spirited Julia: ``People like us cannot live by private impulses for we cannot live private lives.'' Livia, an astute politician and even more adroit survivor, has spent her life helping her husband and advancing Tiberius through the treacherous shoals of Roman politics, where wives, cousins, and closest friends murder and betray with the same diligence that they pursue pleasures equally as sordid. Tiberius, a man who keeps his counsel, successfully fights the Germans, but then--tired of fighting, his marriage disintegrating, and dismayed that the Republic is turning into a despotism--he retires to Rhodes for four years. This tendency of his to cut and run from anything unpleasant will be repeated. He doesn't intervene when estranged wife Julia's scandalous behavior leads to her exile on a remote island; doesn't fight the machinations of his niece Agrippina; and, when he does become Emperor, despairs of reforming the Romans and heads for Capri, where he signs imperial documents but otherwise reads and thinks. Which, of course, means that there are lots of plots and counterplots, plus friends who betray and must be punished. Poor Tiberius, as Livia observes, was always ``a bad judge of character.'' Not as scurrilous as Suetonius or as lively as Graves. More a sententious plod. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

They avoid easy answers and ask the reader to rethink sex work.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;Susie Bright, author of <i>Big Sex Little Death: A Memoir </i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Smith and Mac are sharply honest about the emotional, social and political realities of sex work in all its forms and geographies, eschewing pearl-clutching or cheerleading for a laser-guided honesty and frankness about what can improve the lives and experiences of sex workers around the globe, regardless of social class. <i>Revolting Prostitutes</i> is key to understanding how important the rights of sex workers are, and what is at stake when policy is misguided or clouded in sentimentality and gut-feeling over straight evidence. A must-read for politicians, policy makers, and anyone keen to understand the realities of modern sex work.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;Dawn Foster, author of<i> Lean Out</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Revolting Prostitutes </i>will fuel the fight for sex workers&#x2019; rights with fresh thinking on feminism, deep analysis of policing and the law, and a critical examination of sex work itself.

In this compelling new history William Urban takes up their captivating and turbulent story from 1550 to 1763. The 16th century saw the beginning of a revolution in military technology and strategy. Political and economic systems were radically evolving, too. Mercenaries are often considered a marginal phenomenon, but Urban shows that they were integral to these developments. Increasingly not just individual soldiers and officers became mercenaries, but entire armies of well-equipped, well-trained, and, in time, experienced soldiers were available to friends and allies. By the late-1600s these armies had evolved into large and efficient fighting forces. By the mid-1700s military service had become a profession. The old-fashioned mercenary was less common, but he would not disappear until swept away by the volunteer armies of the French Revolution.</p></p><p>William Urban is the Lee L. Morgan Professor of History at Monmouth College, Illinois, USA. He is the author of numerous works, including the highly acclaimed The Teutonic Knights and Medieval Mercenaries.</p><h2>Merce Cunningham: Changes: Notes on Choreography</h2><p><p>On the occasion of Merce Cunningham&#x2019;s centennial comes this handsome new edition of his classic and long-out-of-print artist&#x2019;s book <i>Changes: Notes on Choreography</i>, first published in 1968 by Dick Higgins&#x2019; Something Else Press. The book presents a revealing exposition of Cunningham&#x2019;s compositional process by way of his working notebooks, containing in-progress notations of individual dances with extensive speculations about the choreographic and artistic problems he was facing.<br><br>Illustrated with over 170 photographs and printed in color and black and white, the book was described by its original publisher as &#x201c;the most comprehensive book on choreography to emerge from the new dance ... [which] will come to stand with Eisenstein&#x2019;s and Stanislavsky&#x2019;s classics on the artistic process.&#x201d; By the time these notebooks were published, Cunningham had already led the Merce Cunningham Dance Company for 15 years, and had collaborated with Cage and others on milestones such as <i>Variations V</i> (1966) and <i>RainForest</i> (1968), the latter with Andy Warhol, David Tudor and Jasper Johns.<br><br>Along with his essay collection <i>Dancing in Space and Time</i> (1978), <i>Changes</i> is one of the most significant publications on Cunningham&#x2019;s enduring contributions to dance, which developed through collaboration with John Cage to incorporate formal innovation with regard to chance, silence and stillness. </p></p><p></p><h2>The Lord Is My Shepherd: Expositions of Selected Psalms</h2><p><p>William Barclay, one of the most beloved of all authors, speaks on one of the most cherished books of the Bible--the Psalms. This unique collection of devotional studies is written in the same distinctive style as Barclay's interpretation of the New Testament in the Daily Study Bible. Each exposition is written not so much as a commentary but as a meditation, making <i>The Lord is My Shepherd</i> ideal for both devotional reading and serious Bible study.</p><p>The William Barclay Library is a collection of books addressing the great issues of the Christian faith. As one of the world's most widely read interpreters of the Bible and its meaning, William Barclay devoted his life to helping people become more faithful disciples of Jesus Christ.</p></p><p><b>William Barclay</b> (1907-1978) is known and loved by millions worldwide as one of the greatest Christian teachers of modern times. His insights into the New Testament, combined with his vibrant writing style, have delighted and enlightened readers of all ages for over half a century. He served for most of his life as Professor of Divinity at the University of Glasgow, and wrote more than fifty books--most of which are still in print today. His most popular work, the <i>Daily Study Bible</i>, has been translated into over a dozen languages and has sold more than ten million copies around the world.</p><h2>Lives in the Shadow with J. Krishnamurti</h2><p>For nearly half a century the charismatic, strikingly handsome spiritual teacher J. Krishnamurti gathered an enormous following throughout Europe, India, Australia and North America. From the age of eighteen he was the forerunner of the type of iconoclasm that would bring immediate fame to cult figures in the late twentieth century. Yet recent biographies have left large areas of his life in mystifying darkness.<p> This, however, is no ordinary study of Krishnamurti, for it is written by one whose earliest memories are dominated by his presence as a doting second father-tolerant of pranks and pets, playful and diligent. For over two decades in their Ojai California haven, where Aldous Huxley and other pacifists found respite during the war years,'Krinsh' developed his philosophical message. He also placed himself at the centre of her parents' Rosalind and Rajagopal's marriage.</p><p> In a spirit of tenderness, fairness, objective inquiry, and no little remorse, the author traces the rise of Krishnamurti from obscurity in India by selection of the Theosophical Society to be the vehicle of a new incarnation of their world teacher. Breaking from Theosophy, Krishnamurti inspired his own following, retaining the dedication of his longtime friend Rajagopal, himself highly educated, to oversee all practicalities and the editing and publication of his writings.</p><p> How this bond of trust was breached and became clouded in confusion with a new wave of devoteeism lies at the heart of this extraordinary story. So does a portrait of intense romantic intimacy and the conundrum of Krishnamurti's own complex character.</p></p><p>RADHA RAJAGOPAL SLOSS grew up in Ojai, California, where her parents and J. Krishnamurti shared a home. She attended Swarthmore and Scripps Colleges and received her M.A. in Comparative Literature at UC Berkeley.

In <i>Lynching and Spectacle</i>, Amy Wood explains what it meant for white Americans to perform and witness these sadistic spectacles and how lynching played a role in establishing and affirming white supremacy. Lynching, Wood argues, overlapped with a variety of cultural practices and performances, both traditional and modern, including public executions, religious rituals, photography, and cinema, all which encouraged the horrific violence and gave it social acceptability. However, she also shows how the national dissemination of lynching images ultimately fueled the momentum of the antilynching movement and the decline of the practice. Using a wide range of sources, including photos, newspaper reports, pro- and antilynching pamphlets, early films, and local city and church records, Wood reconfigures our understanding of lynching's relationship to modern life.<br><br>Wood expounds on the critical role lynching spectacles played in establishing and affirming white supremacy at the turn of the century, particularly in towns and cities experiencing great social instability and change. She also shows how the national dissemination of lynching images fueled the momentum of the antilynching movement and ultimately led to the decline of lynching. By examining lynching spectacles alongside both traditional and modern practices and within both local and national contexts, Wood reconfigures our understanding of lynching's relationship to modern life.<br><br></p><p>" <i>Lynching and Spectacle</i> is a work of both impressive analysis and serious historical craft that makes a number of important contributions to our understanding of the American South and violence there. Combining attention to place, time, and context with an acute sensitivity to cultural expression, ranging from photography and film to journalism, Wood has written the most mature, finely grained, and insightful study of the culture of lynching available."--W.

No matter where we go, what we watch, or how we communicate, our culture is rife with conflict. Unfortunately, Christians appear to be caught up in the same animosity as the culture at large. We are perceived as angry, judgmental, and defensive, fighting among ourselves in various media while the world looks on. How have we failed to be a people of reconciliation and renewal in the face of such tumult?<br><br>Claiming that the church has lost itself in the grip of an antagonistic culture, David Fitch takes a close look at what drives the vitriol in our congregations. He traces the enemy-making patterns in church history and diagnoses the divisiveness that marks the contemporary evangelical church. Fitch shows a way for the church to be true to itself, unwinding the antagonisms of our day and making space for Christ's reconciling presence in our day-to-day lives. He offers new patterns and practices that move the church beyond making enemies to being the presence of Christ in the world, helping us free ourselves from a faith that feeds on division.</p><p><b>The Church as Reconciling Presence<br></b><br>Arguing that the church has lost itself in the grip of an antagonistic culture, David Fitch takes a close look at what drives the vitriol and division in our congregations. He offers new patterns and practices that move the church beyond making enemies to being the presence of Christ in the world.<br><br>"This is a book for our time. The sad reality of our churches and our individual lives is that we have participated in, as well as perpetuated, what David Fitch calls the 'enemy-making machine.' With penetrating analysis of our compromised social condition, Fitch offers a way to move beyond the hostile culture of 'othering' that has damaged our witness to Christ. I couldn't put this book down, which means you would do well to pick it up!"<br>--<b>Rich Villodas</b>, lead pastor, New Life Fellowship, Queens, New York City<br><br>"David Fitch once again calls the church to a better way--that is, the ways that are reflective of the good news of the gospel. While the church continues to experience challenging times, it has been the practice of many to lean on enemy making, antagonisms, strife, and divisiveness. This is <i>the book</i> for such a time as this. As a 'prisoner of hope,' I long for the church to lean into a better, more loving, and more gracious imagination for what it means to be the church on mission. This book is deeply pastoral, prophetic, and winsome."<br>--<b>Tara Beth Leach</b>, senior pastor of PazNaz; author of <i>Emboldened</i><br><br>"We are undoubtedly living in precarious times--perhaps even deserving of being called The Uncivil Wars. It really is hard to find a time when we were so ideological, rancorous, and divided. Pre-World War II Europe comes to mind, and that did not end well. As Bonhoeffer discovered then, only a church that is willing to live radically aligned to Jesus will have anything to say to such a fractious world. This book does precisely that: it calls us to radical discipleship appropriate to the times. And I can't think of a better voice to address this scenario than David Fitch. <i>Bravo</i>, Dave!"<br>--<b>Alan Hirsch</b>, author of numerous award-winning books on leadership, movements, and spirituality; founder of 5Q Collective, 100 Movements, and Forge International (alanhirsch.org)"In this insightful and penetrating work, David Fitch demonstrates how the church has embraced the world's us-vs.-them 'enemy-making machine,' which conditions people to be suspicious if not angry toward those with whom they disagree. At the same time, Fitch casts a bold and beautiful vision of the church as a place 'beyond enemies,' a place where we explore with one another what possibilities the Spirit might be opening up as we debate controversial topics. Whether you are a conservative, moderate, or progressive Christian, you will find <i>The Church of Us vs. Them</i> to be as lucid, insightful, penetrating, and urgent a prophetic call to the church as anything you will ever encounter. This is a genuine eye-opening, game-changing work!"<br>--<b>Greg Boyd</b>, cofounder and senior pastor of Woodland Hills Church, St. Paul, Minnesota<br><br>"This is not a book where we are meant to come to agreement with the author on all things. Instead, Fitch invites us to the table, 'Us and Them,' to relearn the rules for a robust and congenial conversation. Here we discover that the vision must be eschatological--not a pronouncement of enemies on the outside but a recognition that the church has simply 'already' stepped into life in the kingdom and serves as an arbiter of peace. This is a profound and challenging word for all who are trying to navigate life as faithful followers of Jesus Christ."<br>--<b>Carla Sunberg</b>, general superintendent, Church of the Nazarene<br><br>"The world is a divided, antagonistic place. Disjuncture and rupture are not merely by-products of our partisan and blinded social and political engagement; they are the fuel on which they run. The church all too often fumbles over itself playing culture's game by culture's rules and for culture's ends. Into this cultural cyclone, Fitch--with deep insight into the Light from above and the darkness creeping from below--invites the church to reclaim its position as a spiritual director that can see, name, and resist the evil powers now at work in our world."<br>--<b>Sean Isaac Palmer</b>, author of <i>Unarmed Empire: In Search of Beloved Community</i></p><h2>Chess Praxis</h2><p>All the Everyman Chess books are organized in a structured style and are also presented in a series of levels.

Illustrated and written by noted underground cartoonist Jackson, whose previous works chronicled Texas's founding history, this work is a rare combination of historical writing and compassionate storytelling in the graphic novel form. Jackson weaves richly detailed vignettes about the clashes between the Comanches and other Indian tribes and white settlers, rendering the tales in representational fine lines with detailed cross-hatching. The book begins with the unusual account of Cynthia Ann Parker, a white child kidnapped by the Comanches, and the accomplished life of her son, Quanah. Parker's story is as fascinating as it is tragic: after a Comanche raid on her family's fort, she is kidnapped and raised as one of the Comanches' own. Renamed Naduah, Parker adapts all aspects of Comanche life and matures into a respectful, strong-willed daughter. She marries a young chief and gives birth to Quanah. Yet Parker's former life constantly shadows over her. She's eventually recaptured (against her will) by white settler relatives and forced to readjust to their society. Quanah's story takes place after the death of his parents. A young Comanche with few assets or experience, he uses his deft wit and diligence to quickly build himself into a successful horse farmer, a heroic warrior and a diplomatic representative of Native American interests to white society. His integration into American society marks the end of the Comanches' era. Jackson's heartrending and inspiring story is a truly enjoyable and timeless work.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Not only did one hundred fifty Sioux die at the hands of the U.S. Cavalry, the sense was, but Native civilization did as well. </p><p>Growing up Ojibwe on a reservation in Minnesota, training as an anthropologist, and researching Native life past and present for his nonfiction and novels, David Treuer has uncovered a different narrative. Because they did not disappear - and not despite but rather because of their intense struggles to preserve their language, their traditions, their families, and their very existence- the story of American Indians since the end of the nineteenth century to the present is one of unprecedented resourcefulness and reinvention. </p><p>In <i>The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee</i>, Treuer melds history with reportage and memoir. Tracing the tribes' distinctive cultures from first contact, he explores how the depredations of each era spawned new modes of survival. The devastating seizures of land gave rise to increasingly sophisticated legal and political maneuvering that put the lie to the myth that Indians don't know or care about property. The forced assimilation of their children at government-run boarding schools incubated a unifying Native identity. Conscription in the US military and the pull of urban life brought Indians into the mainstream and modern times, even as it steered the emerging shape of self-rule and spawned a new generation of resistance. <i>The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee </i>is the essential, intimate story of a resilient people in a transformative era.</p></p><p></p><h2>For the President&#39;s Eyes Only: Secret Intelligence and the American Presidency from Washington to Bush</h2><p>Based on in-depth research, an examination of how American presidents used secret intelligence is filled with anecdotes, personalities, and surprising events, and reveals that the two most successful soldiers--Washington and Eisenhower--were most skillful at using intelligence.</p><p>Christopher Andrew is Professor of Modern and Contemporary History at Cambridge University, a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, former Visiting Professor of National Security at Harvard University, and guest lecturer at numerous American universities and the CIA. His writings, translated into many languages, have established him as one of the world&#39;s leading authorities in intelligence history. Professor Andrew is also a frequent host of BBC TV and radio programs on history and world affairs.Much of the value returned on America's multibillion-dollar spending on intelligence depends on what the ultimate consumer, the president, does with it. Too often the sum is wasted if he ignores it or wants fortune-telling clairvoyance from it. But a few presidents have justified the expense with their realistic use of confidential information. Writing about each chief executive, Andrew blends the organizational growth of U.S. spy agencies (mostly ad hoc entities until the cold war spawned the CIA and NSA) with presidential predilections of the moment. FDR preferred espionage gathering on people (he was indifferent, unlike Churchill, to the signals intelligence that was possibly decisive in World War II); aerial surveillance tripped up Ike in the U-2 affair; and Nixon's undoing was his penchant for snooping on domestic political opponents. When not telling a revealing anecdote, such as Wilson's naive use of a simple cipher the British had no trouble cracking, Andrew aims his fluid analysis at the intelligence successes and failures in the foreign policy realm--in all, a fascinating synthesis from a premier author of a half-dozen previous espionage histories. An excellent companion acquisition is G. J. O'Toole's Honorable Treachery (1991), a history of U.S. intelligence operations. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>I Served the King of England (Picador Books)</h2><p>In a comic masterpiece following the misadventures of a simple but hugely ambitious waiter in pre-World War II Prague, who rises to wealth only to lose everything with the onset of Communism, Bohumil Hrabal takes us on a tremendously funny and satirical trip through 20th-century Czechoslovakia. <br>First published in 1971 in a typewritten edition, then finally printed in book form in 1989, "I Served the King of England" is "an extraordinary and subtly tragicomic novel" ("The New York Times"), telling the tale of Ditie, a hugely ambitious but simple waiter in a deluxe Prague hotel in the years before World War II.

In her historical novel, first published in 1953, Giles invited the reader to experience the danger and beauty of life on the American frontier.Many of the frontiersmen were hunter in search of escape from an ever advancing civilization, seeking freedom and space. Such a man was David Cooper, who had hunted the Kentucky wilderness with Daniel Boone before the first settlers crossed the Appalachians. No love of land or home or woman had been strong enough to hold David -- until he met Bethia. It was for her that he cleared his patch of forest, planted crops, and built a cabin. Too late, he learned that the girl he had dreamed of marrying was the wife of his enemy.David and Bethia belonged to a generation that never knew or expected security, and the background of their story is one of outnumbered and ill-equipped, were hard put to defend their forts. And, although united in war against the British and their Indian allies, the settlers were at odds among themselves. May, including Boone, held land grants from Judge Henderson&#39;s Transylvania Company. Others, like David, based their claims on the authority of Virginia. Few today realize how close Henderson came to winning out.In her research, Giles studied the journals of the early Kentuckians and has retold their story in their own easy-flowing, cadenced prose. Only the three central characters are fictional. All subsidiary characters and historical events are authentic, set against the background of a country the author knows and loves.Janice Holt Giles (1905-1979), author of nineteen books, lived and wrote near Knifley, Kentucky, for thirty-four years. Her biography is told in Janice Holt Giles: A Writer&#39;s Life.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Isle of Avalon: Sacred Mysteries of Arthur and Glastonbury Tor (Llewellyn&#39;s Celtic Wisdom Series)</h2><p>Journey to a mystical sacred site which resonates with the human heart, mind, and body to open a gateway to another dimension - the legendary island of Avalon.

Laymen, too, are fascinated by relativity theory, which overturned the classical order of Newtonian physics and postulated ideas about space and time that often seem to contradict common sense.<br>The present work is a very clear, concise, and authoritative exposition of both the special and general theories of relativity. Intended for nonscientific readers with a knowledge of high school math, the book offers illuminating coverage of such topics as the speed of light, simultaneity, time distortion of space and mass, journeys to the stars, dimension and hyperspace, the theory of general relativity, anomalies in space, and the structure and evolution of the universe.<br>Readers with an inquisitive bent for cosmic affairs will enjoy this mind-stretching journey into the mysteries and majesty of the physical universe, where they'll share the author's explanations and speculations about why the speed of light is the speed of time, whether it may be possible to travel backward in time, how black holes are formed, how it is possible that space is curved, and much more. For anyone curious about the nature of the universe and how relativity theory continues to help scientists unlock its secrets, this accessible popular treatment is an invaluable companion and guide.</p></p><p></p><h2>Variety Meats (The Good Cook) (Illustrated)</h2><p>Any cook daring enough to experiment with variety meats is almost always pleasantly surprised.

Not only are these genealogies irreconcilable, but the stories of the two accounts of the birth of Jesus, as given by Matthew and Luke, are also radically different. How can this be accounted for? <br><br> An ancient tradition tells that there were two children named Jesus, a year apart in age and both born to parents named Mary and Joseph. These two children, brought up in close proximity, eventually &#x201c;united&#x201d; in a mysterious way, resulting in a single &#x201c;Jesus&#x201d; destined to grow up and fulfill the prophecies of the Old Testament. <br><br> In grappling with this mystery, Nesfield-Cookson uses all available sources&#x2015;biblical accounts, Christian apocryphal writings, Aramaic and Hebrew documents discovered in the Qumran caves in the twentieth century (the &#x201c;Dead Sea Scrolls&#x201d;), writings by Syrian theologians of the thirteenth century, and, in particular, statements by Rudolf Steiner, the first modern thinker&#x2015;to speak of the existence of two Jesus children. The author also refers to the many works of art&#x2015;largely by Italian artists of the Renaissance period&#x2015;which appear to depict two Jesus children. Fifteen of these paintings are reproduced as beautiful, full-color plates. <br><br> The author also develops a parallel theme regarding the mystery of Christ and Jesus&#x2015;the gradual descent of Christ (the Spirit of the Sun) from the spiritual world into the physical body of Jesus.</p><p><b>Bernard Nesfield-Cookson</b> has led a varied professional life as a businessman, school teacher, lecturer, and writer.

Peeling away the theological and scholarly interpretations that have often obscured its most dramatic stories, R. Crumb using the actual text word for word has imagined the Bible as it really was. Now, readers of every persuasion Crumb fans, comic book lovers, history buffs, and believers can gain astonishing new insights from these harrowing, visceral, and even juicy stories. Crumb&#39;s The Book of Genesis reintroduces readers to Adam and Eve&#39;s Eden, Noah&#39;s Ark, Sodom and Gomorrah, and the Pharaoh&#39;s Egypt. Using clues from the text, Crumb fleshes out the parade of biblical originals: from the sensitive dreamer Joseph to the crafty Jacob, to the still-fetching Sarah, to God Himself. The result, four years in the making, is a tapestry of extraordinary detail, the finest work of Crumb&#39;s legendary career.</p><p>Born in Philadelphia, R. Crumb lives in the south of France with his wife and daughter.&#x201c;The best place to witness Crumb's genius. Largely stripped of the sociopolitical context that has made his comics so controversial over the years, <em>Genesis</em>&#x2019; portraits of ancient men and women struggling to survive shows that his primary interest lies in chronicling the physical and mental experience of being human.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Thrillist.com</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Starred Review. Crumb&#x2019;s vivid visual characterizations of the myriad characters, pious and wicked, make the most striking impression. His distinctive, highly rendered drawing style imparts a physicality that few other illustrated versions of this often retold chronicle have possessed. The centenarian elders show every one of their years, and the women, from Eve to Rachel, are as solidly sensual as any others Crumb has so famously drawn.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;To say this book is a remarkable volume or even a landmark volume in comic art is somewhat of an understatement.... stands on its own as one of this century&#x2019;s most ambitious artistic adaptations of the West&#x2019;s oldest continuously told story.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Paul Buhle, <em>The Jewish Daily Forward</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a cartoonist&#x2019;s equivalent of the Sistine Chapel.

But never have I found it so compelling. By placing it squarely in the Middle East&#x2015;and populating it with distinctively Semitic-looking people&#x2015;Crumb makes it come alive brilliantly.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Susan Jane Gilman, <em>Morning Edition, NPR</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[A] beautifully drawn and relentlessly faithful rendition of the first 50 chapters of the Bible by an apostle of the 1960s and sometimes profane progenitor of underground comics.

In fact, &#x201c;the mysteries of Montecito&#x201d; have been the subject of many discussions and articles. Now, for the first time, a carefully researched book is available about the community and its history. Tales about the settlement have been wildly imaginative; even those carefully confirmed provide intriguing reading of this fabled suburb of Santa Barbara. <p>Montecito was a possible candidate for a Franciscan mission back in 1784. Its hot springs&#x2014;with alleged curative powers&#x2014;drew health seekers, and La Parra Grande&#x2014;the enormous grapevine with romantic origins&#x2014;was one of Santa Barbara&#x2019;s early tourist attractions. </p><p>The early settlers were Indians, and ex-Presidio soldiers given small parcels of land in lieu of back pay. Next came men from the East Coast who cleared the brush and established citrus ranches. With the passage of time there were fires and floods, but still the population grew and land prices rose. The agriculture was impressive, and the crops suggested colorful gardens to winter residents from the East. By the turn of the 20th century, some large estates had been created by men of great wealth. More luxurious estates would appear in the next few decades. </p><p>The climate and beauty of the area supported great hotels and resorts in both Montecito and Santa Barbara, and encouraged new residents to establish churches and country clubs. The Montecito Country Club had three locations and four clubhouses, of which one was destroyed by an unknown arsonist. </p><p>Essentially, this volume carries the story of Montecito to 1940, together with tales of some of the estates and their colorful owners. The second volume tells of more estates, schools, and the many that occurred in the next half century. The text is supplemented by photographs and maps, taking the reader back in time.</p></p><p>An expert historian specializing in the American West, David F. Myrick has written over fifteen books and pamphlets on the histories of railroads and mines in Nevada, Eastern California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Bolivia, as well as histories of San Francisco&#x2019;s Telegraph Hill and the communities of Montecito and Santa Barbara. He has been a board member of national, state, and local historical societies in California, Nevada, and Arizona.

What he discovered over the decades that followed went far beyond the tangled wreckage of military aircraft, both fighters and bombers. For with each of the thousands of RAF and Luftwaffe artefacts he unearthed, came the intricate weave of life stories linking the valiant and the brave, the living and the dead.<br><br>Included among the items he has recovered from the many wreck sites he has investigated, was a mud-cloaked control column from a Spitfire with its gun button still switched to firing mode, a piece of Dornier Do 17 fuselage bearing the fatal bullet holes which led it to crash to the of earth of south-east England, a pilot&#x2019;s waistcoat once used to stop the drafts and rattles in a Hurricane cockpit, blood-stained maps from a Luftwaffe bomber, and a buckled tail fin from a Me 110 bearing the unmistakable symbol of the swastika.<br><br>Now in this exclusive biography, created from Terry&#x2019;s original notes and photographs stretching back almost seventy years, we learn not only about the historical significance of his own story as a wreck-hunter but the importance of remembering the lives of the men who fought in the skies above Britain in those desperate days of the Second World War.<br><br>Indeed, this book shows us how one man&#x2019;s pioneering commitment to aviation archaeology ultimately serves as a unique tribute to thousands of young souls both lost and found of the Battle of Britain and the Blitz.</p><p>MELODY FOREMAN is a qualified journalist and graduate with experience in newspapers and television documentaries.

The result is a misunderstanding of both the council as a whole and the liturgical reform that followed from it.</p>In <i>True Reform</i>, Faggioli takes <i>Sacrosanctum Concilium</i> as a hermeneutical key to the council. He offers a thorough reflection on the relationship between the liturgical constitution and the whole achievement of Vatican II and argues that the interconnections between the two must emerge if we want to understand the impact of the council on global Catholicism.</p><p>"Massimo Faggioli has emerged as one of the most insightful and energetic young scholars in Catholic theology today. In this bold new book, Faggioli makes a compelling argument that the significance of Vatican II's Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy was not limited to liturgical reform; the document established a compelling ecclesiological vision that set the agenda for later conciliar documents and the post-conciliar church. Faggioli lays out for us what is really at stake in the many recent assaults on the council's liturgical reform--nothing less than an assault on the entire ecclesiology of the Council. This book belongs on the short list of those truly indispensable studies of the Second Vatican Council."<br> <br> -Richard R. Gaillardetz<br>McCarthy Professor of Systematic Theology<br>Boston College<br> "True Reform is a thoroughly documented analysis of Sacrosanctum Concilium and its reception by the Second Vatican Council itself. The document's connection with the ecclesiology of the Council emerges fully. In this way, the book provides a deep understanding of the Council in its liturgical dimension and its unavoidable call to reform the Church in order to be more faithful to the Gospel of Jesus Christ."<br> <br> -Fr. Enzo Bianchi<br>Founder and prior of the ecumenical monastic Community of Bose<br> "This is a valuable, even groundbreaking, study for the interpretation of Vatican II. Faggioli succeeds in showing how the liturgy constitution and the subsequent liturgical reform are essential for the understanding and implementation of the Council. It should be required reading for ecclesiologists and historians of the contemporary Church as well as for students of the liturgy--perhaps even for members of the Roman Curia."<br> <br> -John F. Baldovin, SJ<br>Professor of Historical and Liturgical Theology<br>Boston College<p>Massimo Faggioli is professor of theology and religious studies at Villanova University and a contributing editor for <i>Commonweal</i>. Among his books with Liturgical Press are <i>True Reform: Liturgy and Ecclesiology in </i>Sacrosanctum Concilium (2012); <i>Pope John XXIII:</i><i> The Medicine of Mercy</i> (2014);<i></i>and <i>Sorting Out Catholicism: A Brief History of the New Ecclesial Movements</i> (2014).</p></p><h2>Longarm #428: Longarm and the Death Cave</h2><p><b>Longarm knows where the bodies are buried...</b> <p></p>After her husband is killed in front of her, wealthy widow Frances Mayfield insists on hiring a bodyguard. And who better than the man that rescued her from the attackers--Deputy U.S. Marshal Custis Long?

Having failed to kill the rich rancher's wife, her enemies are attempting to frame her with this tomb of slaughtered sodbusters. <p></p> But the villains should have dug a grave for themselves, because Longarm is coming for them...</p><p><b>Tabor Evans</b> is the author of the long-running Longarm western series, featuring the adventures of Deputy U.S. Marshal Custis Long.</p><h2>Hellboy: Weird Tales, Vol. 2</h2><p>Mike Mignola&#x2019;s character has never been more popular, especially in the wake of the long-awaited feature film, and unprecedented success in bookstores. His award-winning series Hellboy has been lauded as much by other artists as it has by award ceremonies and fans. Over the years, many of the best artists in the industry have asked if they could do a backup story just to get a chance to play with the characters and worlds Mignola has created. As Dark Horse basks in the glow of critical praise for the 2004 Hellboy motion picture, we present this lavish collection of stories.</p><p>Mike Mignola's popular character Hellboy is headed toward the big screen, and Mignola's turned him over to an array of creators to produce short stories, collected in this volume. Hellboy is a devilish looking paranormal investigator with a sense of humor, and his adventures are infused with a spooky gothic horror, sarcastic wit and a sense of movie serial fun held over from the 1940s. Hellboy's basic concept is broad, allowing creators room to play with ghosts, demons, foreign landscapes and a well-designed character who lends himself to a multitude of interpretations from dead serious to wacky. The collection of 13 stories has no duds, and quite a few excellent pieces. Of the more successful ones, a few stand out. Bob Fingerman's hilarious slapstick version of Hellboy has him investigating a soda machine that ate his dollar. John Cassaday contributes a solemn and cinematic story about a ghostly circus that pays off with a dramatic ending. And Andi Watson tells a seemingly serious birthday story with a touching finale. Roger Langridge and Eric Powell keep things light, both contributing funny, lovingly rendered stories that treat Hellboy and the paranormal as fertile ground for jokes. This entertaining collection is accessible to even the Hellboy neophyte, and highly recommended for adventure comics lovers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Hellboy, the demon-turned-paranormal-investigator who recently made the move from comic books to the big screen, returns in another collection of adventures in which he tracks down phenomena ranging from a poltergeist World War II pilot to a ghostly Grand Guignol troupe. Here, as in the first <i>Weird Tales</i> [BKL F 1 04], Hellboy creator Mike Mignola turns his creation over to pinch hitters including mainstream superhero artists Jim Starlin and Gene Colan, fan-favorites Jill Thompson (<i>Sandman, Scary Godmother</i>) and P. Craig Russell (<i>The Ring of the Nibelung</i>), and acclaimed alternative-comics writer-artists Craig Thompson (<i>blankets</i>) and Scott Morse (<i>Barefoot Serpent</i>), who seldom dabble in genre work. A bonus section sports full-page illustrations of the hero by such stellar illustrators as Dave Stevens, Michael Kaluta, and Frank Cho. The package is uneven but seldom less than entertaining, and a wide range of approaches to Hellboy, from Kia Asamiya and Akira Yoshide's <i>manga</i>-like story about ghostly children to Evan Dorkin's cartoony tale of Norwegian metalheads and a baby frost giant, make for a heterogeneity most similar collections lack. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

How do the jaws of a T.Rex measure up to those of a shark or a lion? How could an Allosaurus eat as much as it did without getting sick? What happens when an Albertosaurus takes on a Carnotaurus? Bite of the Allosaurus is a snarling, bone-crunching look at the biggest beasts that ever lived!</p><p><p><b>ARNAUD PLUMERI</b> has been a fanatic of paleontology and comics since early childhood. After many years of research, he's finally able to bring these two passions together in DINOSAURS.</p><p><b>BLOZ</b> has illustrated several best-selling graphic novel series. DINOSAURS gives him the opportunity to show yet another facet of his talent, all while pleasing his kids!</p>Plumeri and Bloz&#x2019; silly first volume, Dinosaurs #1 (2013), introduced kids to less-well-known dinosaurs in an appealing format, and they present even more facts about prehistoric creatures in this second installment. This time around, the plethora of facts include identifying dinosaurs by the shape of their feet and how dinosaurs get their odd names, such as Bienosaurus crichtoni, named for Jurassic Park author Michael Crichton, and Gasosaurus, which was discovered during a search for gasoline. (Gasosaurus is also the perfect vehicle for a fart joke, of course.) For the sheer number of dinosaur names dropped, Plumeri and Bloz&#x2019; series is impressive, but they deserve extra kudos for peppering the facts with jokey, sometimes crass visual humor, ensuring that the science goes down easy. The cartoon dinosaurs and paleontologists have the loopy quality of an Asterix comic. The dinosaurs in this volume are far and away more obscure than those in the first, but that should only serve to pique the interest of young fans of weird and wonderful creatures.

Never has a more exuberant man been our nation's leader. He became a war hero, reformed the NYPD, busted the largest railroad and oil trusts, passed the Pure Food and Drug Act, created national parks and forests, won the Nobel Peace Prize, and built the Panama Canal to name just a few.</p><p>Yet it was the cause he championed the hardest America's entry in to WWI that would ultimately divide and destroy him. His youngest son, Quentin, his favorite, would die in an air fight. How does looking at Theodore's relationship with his son, and understanding him as a father, tell us something new about this larger-than-life-man? Does it reveal a more human side? A more hypocritical side? Or simply, if tragically, a nature so surprisingly sensitive, despite the bluster, that he would die of a broken heart?</p><p>Roosevelt's own history of boyhood illnesses made him so aware of was like to be a child in pain, that he could not bear the thought of his own children suffering. The Roosevelts were a family of pillow-fights, pranks, and "scary bear." And it was the baby, Quentin the frailest who worried his father the most. Yet in the end, it was he who would display, in his brief life, the most intellect and courage of all."</p></p><p>Eric Burns is a former correspondent for NBC News and the TODAY Show.

Brennan had always assumed it was a more intellectual state. He tapped a finger on the photo of the woman staring up at him from the folded newspaper. &#x201c;This is she?&#x201d; </p><p>Something tugged at him; some flash of, what? Recognition? Admiration? The reporter&#x2019;s face, even in the grainy black-and-white of the newsprint, was beautiful. But it was a quality in the look of her eyes that had captured his attention. Perhaps it was a trick of the light, but it was almost as if he could read the sadness haunting them. </p><p>Or perhaps more than two thousands of years without emotion had destroyed his ability to discern it in others. Especially through such an inaccurate prism as that of a newspaper photograph. </p><p>High Prince Conlan nodded and resumed his pacing. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s her. She&#x2019;s our reporter contact, and she has news of who&#x2014;or what&#x2014;might be behind the shifter attacks in Yellowstone.&#x201d; Conlan shot a wary glance at his brother Ven, then at Brennan. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s also the one you, ah, the one&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The one you went miertus over and had some kind of convulsions about back in Boston,&#x201d; Alexios added dryly. </p><p>As members of Conlan&#x2019;s elite guard, the Seven, handpicked from among the best of the best of the Warriors of Poseidon, Alexios and Brennan had trained and fought together for centuries in the continuing battle to protect humanity from the dark forces that sought to destroy and enslave it. Both were masters at remaining calm and in control under pressure; Brennan through a god&#x2019;s dictate, Alexios through decades of training. </p><p>Except, from what Alexios and Christophe had told him, Brennan had failed spectacularly during one crucial mission, going so far as to kill a vampire they&#x2019;d needed to question. Also, even more unbelievably, he&#x2019;d then threatened his own friends and fellow warriors&#x2014;all over a human female. </p><p>Tiernan Butler. </p><p>He almost could not&#x2014;would not&#x2014;believe it. If it had been only Christophe who recounted the tale, he most certainly would not have believed it. Christophe&#x2019;s sly sense of humor often caused him to find sport in mocking Brennan&#x2019;s emotionless existence. But Alexios was a different matter. Alexios would never, ever lie to him. </p><p>And there was the small matter of the dreams. Flashes of what he now believed to be memories, persistent in spite of the curse. Holding the soft warmth of her body in his arms. Looking down into the bottomless depths of her dark, dark eyes. </p><p>&#x201c;Thus, it must be true,&#x201d; he murmured, coming to the unpleasant conclusion he&#x2019;d refused previously to accept. Some of his control was finally cracking. After so many years, perhaps even the strongest of steel became brittle. Or&#x2014;worse&#x2014;the curse was coming to its fulfillment. Would that be worse or better? He dismissed the question as irrelevant; worse or better, what would be, would be. </p><p>Alexios leaned against the battered wooden table that had seen so many of their planning sessions, and stared off into the distance, studying the ancient tapestries that lined the walls. Or simply trying to avoid meeting Brennan&#x2019;s gaze. </p><p>Ven, slouched in an overstuffed chair, one long leg thrown over the side, finally spoke up. &#x201c;Look, we need to quit dancing around this. We&#x2019;ve got to send somebody, preferably a team, to Yellowstone to help Lucas and his wolf shifters defend themselves against the attacks from outside and, even more important, I think, attacks from inside the pack. The threat of vampire enthrallment is growing every day. Tiernan is our contact, and she&#x2019;s undercover doing the story on the science conference and the vamp regional leader there, so we need to work with her. So, major problem: can Brennan work with her or not?&#x201d; </p><p>Brennan straightened and inclined his head toward Ven, then put a touch of frost in his voice. &#x201c;If the vampires are truly able to enthrall shape-shifters now, which they have never been able to do in all the millennia of their existence, this matter is of crucial importance to our mission.&#x201d; He flashed a glance at Alexios and then returned his gaze to Ven, whose relaxed pose could not quite hide the lethal danger of one named the King&#x2019;s Vengeance. &#x201c;I am perfectly capable, Your Highness. I am sure that whatever happened in Boston was a one-time aberration.&#x201d;</p> <p>Ven rolled his eyes and repeated his familiar threat. &#x201c;Call me &#x2018;Highness&#x2019; again, and I&#x2019;ll kick your ass. I&#x2019;m just Conlan&#x2019;s brother, my friend. Leader of the Seven and uncle to one very adorable little baby boy. If we&#x2019;re going to give young Prince Aidan an Atlantis that can rise to the surface, and a surface worth rising to, we need to solve the puzzle behind how these vamps are suddenly able to enthrall shifters when they never could before.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Tiernan says that whatever they&#x2019;re doing to the humans is different, too,&#x201d; Conlan pointed out. &#x201c;She and her contacts have proof. Brain scans and the like. This isn&#x2019;t just temporary anymore. The vamps are changing the humans&#x2019; entire brain-wave patterns to keep them permanently in thrall.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;At this rate, the bloodsuckers will turn all of humanity into nothing but herds of sheep for their dining pleasure in a matter of years&#x2014;or maybe even months,&#x201d; Alexios added. &#x201c;I volunteer to go. Lucas, the alpha of the Yellowstone wolf pack, is an old friend. He even gave me the honor of naming me second pack-father to his new twin boys, and I have yet to see them or bring a birth gift.&#x201d; </p><p>Ven grinned. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m sure the lovely Grace will bring along her bow and arrows and keep your ugly butt in line.&#x201d; </p><p>Brennan was intrigued to see the dark red flush that rose in Alexios&#x2019;s scarred face, partially hidden by the long waves of golden hair that had once so intrigued the women of Atlantis. Of course, that was before Alexios had returned from one of the darker levels of the nine hells, with his face and his soul scarred beyond&#x2014;or so they&#x2019;d feared&#x2014;any hope of redemption. To be precise, only the left side of his face was scarred, a going-away present of sorts from the vampire goddess Anubisa after two long years of torture. </p><p>Grace had brought Alexios back into the light. Brennan wished he had the capacity to feel the joy for his friend that he knew everyone else shared. Alexios&#x2019;s new lady love, who was both human and more, as a descendant of the goddess Diana, was indeed a formidable warrior in her own right. </p><p>&#x201c;Grace doesn&#x2019;t need to put herself in any more danger, especially now,&#x201d; Alexios muttered, a look of grim resignation on his face. &#x201c;But I may as well spit into the wind as tell her that.&#x201d; </p><p>Almost as if on cue, the door opened and Grace walked in, accompanied by Conlan&#x2019;s new bride and infant son, High Princess Riley and Prince Aidan. </p><p>Ven started laughing. &#x201c;Busted! It&#x2019;s like they have radar.&#x201d; </p><p>Conlan swiftly crossed to his wife, who handed him the baby. The intense emotion on Conlan and Riley&#x2019;s faces as they gazed at each other and then at the child stirred something dry and barren deep inside Brennan. He filed the sensation away to consider later. A curiosity, no more. </p><p>Riley suddenly looked up and cast a startled glance at Brennan. &#x201c;Brennan? Was that you?&#x201d; </p><p>He bowed. &#x201c;I beg your pardon, my lady?&#x201d; </p><p>She shook her head, sunshine-gold hair fl ying. &#x201c;No . . . It&#x2019;s nothing, I guess,&#x201d; she said, her brows drawing together. &#x201c;I thought . . . No. Nothing.&#x201d; She laughed. &#x201c;Being aknasha and a new mother certainly is interesting. Not only can I pick up emotions from everyone around me, but I&#x2019;ve got an overload of my own to deal with. It makes my mind play tricks on me.&#x201d; </p><p>Brennan raised an eyebrow, but she didn&#x2019;t elaborate. He briefly wondered if her emotional empathy had sensed some emotion hidden deep down in his psyche, but he had to discard the idea as impossible. Although there had been that one time when Riley&#x2019;s sister Quinn, an even more powerful aknasha, had claimed to feel buried emotion from him . . . But he&#x2019;d doubted Quinn&#x2019;s claim then, and he doubted it now. Poseidon&#x2019;s curses were not so easily broken. He&#x2019;d spent many lifetimes coming to that realization. </p><p>Grace, a study in lean elegance with her swimmer&#x2019;s body, honey-gold skin, and long, dark hair, crossed the room to Alexios, whose entire face lit up at the sight of her. She leaned into him for a moment, then took a position against the wall next to him and flashed a saucy grin at Conlan and Ven. &#x201c;So, boys. What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; </p><p>Alexios looked simultaneously chagrined and amused. &#x201c;You probably shouldn&#x2019;t call the high prince and his brother &#x2018;boys,&#x2019;&#x201d; he muttered. </p><p>Ven laughed. &#x201c;Please. She&#x2019;s fine. Great, even. Trust me, it&#x2019;s way better than &#x2018;pigheaded fool,&#x2019; which is what I got from Erin this morning before I&#x2019;d even gotten out of bed. Seems like my suggestion I go along on her trip to Seattle to visit her friends was &#x2018;being overprotective.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s not like she nearly got killed by a traitor in that witch&#x2019;s coven or anything.&#x201d; His tone was light, but Brennan noticed that Ven&#x2019;s hands clenched into fists at his sides at the memory of Erin&#x2019;s brushes with death. </p><p>Riley shook her head at Ven. &#x201c;You should know better by now. She is a very powerful witch and needs to work with others in her circle to refine her control over the Wilding magic. If you want to go along as the man she loves, that&#x2019;s one thing. But as the big, tough guy who can protect the helpless little woman? Not so much.&#x201d; </p><p>Ven snorted. &#x201c;Women.&#x201d; But then his eyes widened, and he jumped up out of his chair. &#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll just go help her pack. Do we have this mission resolved? Alexios and Grace are heading to Yellowstone to see what they can find out, protect the wolves, so on and so forth?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes, it is resolved. Alexios and Grace and I will go to Yellowstone,&#x201d; Brennan said firmly, leaving no room for them to doubt his resolve. &#x201c;There is also the matter of the final missing gems from the Trident. We must discover where the tourmaline, aquamarine, and amethyst have been hidden and retrieve them, or Atlantis cannot rise.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I love the gem names,&#x201d; Riley said. &#x201c;Poseidon&#x2019;s Pride, the Emperor, and the Siren. Has Alaric figured out which is which yet?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Conlan said, holding his son to his shoulder and patting the infant&#x2019;s back. A resounding burp sounded in the room, and everyone laughed. </p><p>&#x201c;He takes after his uncle Ven,&#x201d; Conlan said, grinning. Then his expression turned serious and he aimed a measuring stare at Brennan. &#x201c;Are you sure? We can&#x2019;t afford an incident if you react to the reporter as you did before. I am inclined to trust you, of course, as my father and those before him have trusted you for two millennia. But something is off about your reaction to her.&#x201d; </p><p>Brennan, who had never disclosed the full terms of the curse to anyone, not even the kings and princes he&#x2019;d served, nodded slowly. He was quite aware of the wrongness of his reaction to Tiernan Butler. The sea god&#x2019;s proclamation rang in his mind: only when Brennan met his destined mate would his emotions return to him. But then he would forget her when she was out of his sight. </p><p>Destined mate. Destined to reach the soul-meld? But the Atlanteans&#x2019; most prized tenet was free will. Even lovers who had achieved the rare and precious state of being known as the soul-meld could choose to part, though it stunned Brennan to think that any would give up such a precious gift. </p><p>No matter, though. If the curse were coming to the fruition of its terms, he would need to be very, very careful indeed around Tiernan Butler, although an almost primal need drove him to see her again. To test his hypothesis. </p><p>Perhaps, after all these long, long years, to finally feel again. Even if just for a very short time. </p><p>He realized everyone was staring at him. &#x201c;I am aware of the seriousness of the dilemma and will take all precautions,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But the members of the Seven are spread precariously thin these days. Lord Justice has gone to England with Dr. McDermott, Bastien is busy with Kat and the tripartite alliance building with the humans and panther shifters in Miami, and Christophe and Denal&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve gone on a mission for me,&#x201d; Ven interrupted. &#x201c;Yes, you&#x2019;re right. I never thought to see so many of the Seven gone away on so many different tasks, but the world is changing, and we must keep up with it. Perhaps Conlan should appoint some of you as official ambassadors and select new warriors to become part of his personal guard.&#x201d; </p><p>Conlan was shaking his head before Ven even finished his sentence. &#x201c;No, I won&#x2019;t break up this team. You&#x2019;re right about the need for ambassadorial roles, but&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;But this is something we can consider at another time, maybe?&#x201d; Riley asked. &#x201c;For now, your son and I would like to have dinner with his daddy.&#x201d; </p><p>Prince Aidan&#x2019;s tiny mouth opened and he let out a loud wail as if in vehement agreement, and Conlan laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;For now, Brennan and Alexios will go to Yellowstone, discover what they can, and report back as soon as they learn anything.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And Grace,&#x201d; Grace added, raising her chin. </p><p>&#x201c;And Grace,&#x201d; Conlan conceded. </p><p>Alexios opened his mouth as if to argue, but subsided after Grace shot a narrow-eyed glare his way. </p><p>&#x201c;The world is changing, and this is only a discover-and-report mission. No danger,&#x201d; Grace reminded him. Alexios scowled down at her, but the heat in his eyes belied the ferocity of his expression. </p><p>Again, something inside Brennan twisted&#x2014;just the smallest of twinges, but enough to drive him to conclude the meeting. &#x201c;Shall we reconvene at the portal in an hour?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;One hour,&#x201d; Alexios said. </p><p>Brennan gestured for everyone to precede him out of the room. Riley glanced back at Brennan over her shoulder as Conlan took the baby and walked ahead, laughing. She hesitated for a moment, biting her lip, but then she offered a brief smile and followed her husband and child as they left the room. </p><p>When the last of them had gone through the door, Brennan picked up the folded paper and carefully tore out Tiernan&#x2019;s photograph and put it in his pocket. For recognition purposes, of course. He&#x2019;d need to recognize her when he saw her. </p><p>Or at least that&#x2019;s what he tried to convince himself. </p></p><h2>A Small Death in Lisbon</h2><p>Klaus Felsen, press-ganged into the SS, has arrived at the strangest party in history which affects the next 50 years. Inspector Coelho is investigating the death of a young girl and finds he&#39;s turning the dark soil of history.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, August 2000:</b> Winner of the prestigious Gold Dagger Award in the U.K. for the best mystery of 1999, this complex literary thriller may be one of the most satisfying suspense novels to come along in some time. Robert Wilson has written several political thrillers, most of which are set in West Africa, but they are, alas, largely unavailable in the U.S.<p> In <i>A Small Death in Lisbon</i>, the narrative switches back and forth between 1941 and 1999, and Wilson's wide knowledge of history and keen sense of place make the eras equally vibrant. In 1941 Germany, Klaus Felsen, an industrialist, is approached by the SS high command in a none-too-friendly manner and is "persuaded" to go to Lisbon and oversee the sale--or smuggling--of wolfram (also known as tungsten, used in the manufacture of tanks and airplanes). World War II Portugal is neutral where business is concerned, and too much of the precious metal is being sold to Britain when Germany needs it to insure that Hitler's blitzkrieg is successful.</p><p> Cut to 1999 Lisbon, where the daughter of a prominent lawyer has been found dead on a beach. Ze Coehlo, a liberal police inspector who is a widower with a daughter of his own, must sift through the life of Catarina Oliviera and discover why she was so brutally murdered. Her father is enigmatic, her mother suicidal; her friends were rock musicians and drug addicts.</p><p> The reader is treated to a wonderful portrait of Lisbon in the aftermath of the 1974 revolution that ousted Salazar from power, and the scars from that conflict are still close to the surface for the citizens of Lisbon, including Coehlo and his colleagues. We also see World War II in a slightly different manner from that to which we are accustomed--through the eyes of the Germans and the Portuguese. The pace of the book is leisurely but compelling as the events of 1941 and those in 1999 merge in an extraordinary climax. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Robert Wilson has spent several years in West Africa, and he drew on this experience for his Bruce Medway novels. He and his wife now live in Portugal, the setting for `A Small Death in Lisbon&#39;.</p><h2>Spectator&#39;s Guide to World Religions, A: An Introduction to the Big Five</h2><p>In this timely book, John Dickson presents each of the world&#39;s major religions.

He soon learns his former lover has disappeared, but what hes about to uncover is far more diabolical than he could ever have imagined. Light Before Day is a riveting and complex mystery set against the gothic landscape that Rice has made his own.</p><p>Christopher Rice is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling novels <i>A Density of Souls</i> and <i>The Snow Garden</i>, and writes a regular column for the <i>Advocate</i>. He lives in Los Angeles.In West Hollywood, a meth lab explosion is tied to the disappearance of three gay men, as well as the suicide of a Marine. Young journalist Adam Murphy is on the trail of this story, aided by a bestselling novelist. Dallas Roberts gives Adam a burnt-out voice that creates a sense of impending danger as it also brings home his struggles with alcohol and drug addiction. The novel is laced with profanity and sexual detail in its portrayal of the West Hollywood gay scene. While Roberts effectively portrays its "noir" ambience, the story's unrelenting chill may come across as too strong for some listeners.

Clifford Wright's <i>Real Stew</i> offers 300 recipes for this delicious fare--everything from basic Irish stew through stroganoff, bouillabaisse, gumbo, feijoada, and much more. What makes Wright's dishes--and cookbook--different from similar efforts (besides its "all-under-one-roof" commitment) is his insistence on authenticity. Readers will find, for example, a recipe for the famous French Daube Proven�ale that calls for salt pork in addition to slab bacon, plus beef or veal foot, among other ingredients. Wright's devotion to the real thing will excite most readers, and while it may discourage others, all will find the recipes clear and easy to follow. The results of Wright's devotion to formulas in every way justify the kitchen (and shopping) duty required.<p>The recipe selection is definitive. The section on lamb stews, for example, contains over 50 mouthwatering recipes, from the paprika-hot Classic Lamb Stew of Andalusia; piquant Abruzzi Lamb Stew with Egg and Lemon Custard; and Sweetly Saffroned Lamb, Onion, and Golden Raisin Stew of the Jews of Morocco; to Indian Rogan Josh and Martinique-Style Mutton Curry, among others. Other sections, like those on seafood stews and vegetable stews, are equally comprehensive--and enticing. Wright also provides inviting background material, and sidebars such as "What's a Cardoon?" and "Cuisine of the Poor," which details the birth of many stew-type dishes. With notes on equipment and a comprehensive list of ingredient sources, the book is full of worthwhile information as well as wonderful cooking. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Clifford A.

He told the frozen truth. To be out in the open where fish are; to watch them at their great business of living; to see them in the water or out of the water; to fish for them, and even to hook them and have them get away-all this is wonderfully worth while-wonderfully better worth while than merely to catch and keep the stiffening fading body of one of the most beautiful forms of life.</p><p></p><h2>Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor&#39;s Plan to Make Us Safer</h2><p>For half a century, the approach to fighting crime has been ineffective and rooted in false choices. When two-thirds of people released from prison are later convicted of a new crime, the system just isn&#39;t working. In this book, Kamala Harris, a career prosecutor in the U.S., shatters the old distinctions and offers a cogent and compelling argument for changes in the roles of prosecutors, judges, prisons, and the community.</p><p>This is a policy focused book on what is wrong with the U.S. criminal justice system and how to fix it, with an emphasis on making Americans all safer in their homes and on the streets. The author is a charismatic, nationally prominent black woman District Attorney of San Francisco who is on her way to higher office and greater things. Introduction to the book will be personal, describing how Harris got to her vision of what needs to be done. The rest of the book will not be self promotional or focused on Harris, but a real analysis. Throughout the book, there will be quotes from prominent policymakers giving their first person views on certain key points; and profiles of individual people involved in the innovative program Harris has started. Kamala's first and only priority is public safety. The usual way of looking at approach to crime is wrong: not "tough" or "soft"; should be "smart."

He&#39;s a breed, a type. There are Murdochs all across northern Australia and they run to kind. White or beige Toyota Land Cruiser HZJ75 utility. Canvas canopy off the back with built-in flyscreen mesh. Six-pack foam esky for up front of the cab on long drives and a serious full-grown Rubbermaid esky for the back of vehicle to be accessed on piss-stops. Engel electric car fridge, naturally. Cop-type swivel camping spotlight at the rear. Weapons of various types - revolvers, pistols, rifles, bludgeons. Loves his mates but always disappointed by women&#39;. In the twenty years since Azaria Chamberlain&#39;s disappearance, Territory death has lost none of its fascination. Murder is murder, wherever it happens, but when it collides with tourist country - the Australian outback - it usually sparks a frenzy of speculation and blame. When Peter Falconio disappeared on 14 July 2001, his girlfriend Joanne Lees endured a trial by media, Lindy Chamberlain style. Falconio&#39;s body was never recovered, but Brad Murdoch was found guilty of his murder in December 2005 and given a non-parole period of 28 years: one year for every year of the British backpacker&#39;s young life. Paul Toohey takes us right inside the crazed world of Bradley John Murdoch - a life lived on the road, fuelled by drugs and alcohol - a heady mix of racism, guns and nothingness. It&#39;s about the weirdness of north and western Australia, and what happens when distance, heat and lawlessness take control.</p><p>Paul Toohey covered Peter Falconio&#39;s disappearance for The Australian and the subsequent committal and trial of Bradley John Murdoch for The Bulletin, where he has been a senior writer since 2003.

Now, this classic guide has been revised to include today&#39;s most successful investment strategies. With its phenomenal analysis of financial market returns since 1802, no other book offers such an in-depth historical��and yet timely��perspective on what drives the market.</p><p>If anyone told you that investing in the stock market was the safest investment you could make, you might raise an eyebrow. However, if Jeremy Siegel tells you this, prepare to be convinced. Siegel's book, <i>Stocks for the Long Run</i>, is a comprehensive and highly readable history of the stock market that dramatically makes the case for long-term investing in stocks. <p> In summing up his approach to investing, Siegel writes, "Poor investment strategy, whether it is for lack of diversification, pursuing hot stocks, or attempting to time the market, often stems from the investor's belief that it is necessary to beat the market to do well in the market. Nothing is further from the truth. The principle of this book is that through time the after-inflation returns on a well-diversified portfolio of common stocks have not only exceeded that of fixed income assets but have actually done so with less risk. Which stocks you own is secondary to whether you own stocks, especially if you maintain a balanced portfolio."</p><p> <i>Stocks for the Long Run</i> considers subjects as diverse as the history of the various market indices and what makes for a business cycle to contrarian indicators and the utility of 200-day moving averages. If you've just come into investing in the last few years and feel the need for a solid and comprehensive text about the market, <i>Stocks for the Long Run</i> is probably the best primer available. It also works as an excellent reference for seasoned investors and anyone else interested in how the market works. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i></p>Jeremy Siegel's 1994 book, <i>Stocks for the Long Run</i>, makes for dry but very interesting reading. A finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Siegel has compiled some of the most thorough information about stock market performance over time relative to other asset classes that can be found for such a low price. The book is frequently used as a reference by various Fool HQ writers who are looking for the authoritative numbers on how stocks have done over various time periods. <p> Siegel analyzes stock returns and large-scale economic factors deftly, pausing to focus on specific historical issues that demonstrate the idea of stocks being a superior investment vehicle over long periods of time. His analysis of the performance of the Nifty Fifty stocks bought at their high in 1973 through the early 1990s is one particularly interesting stopping point, and his work on gold, recessions and taxes all make for interesting sidebars as well. Although some of the peripheral stuff may not exactly be Foolish, the general conclusion that stocks make superior long-term investment vehicles certainly is.</p></p><h2>May Bird Among the Stars: Book Two</h2><p>May Bird has always been a bit...different. While most of her classmates were riding their bikes, she was running around the woods dressed as a warrior princess with her hairless cat at her side. And instead of spending summer vacation at birthday parties, May was discovering a mysterious lake hidden among the trees -- and stumbling into the land of ghosts, the Ever After. <br> <br> A fearful and fantastic realm located among the stars, the Ever After is full of all manner of things that go bump in the night. And if May is to find her way out again, she must reach the mysterious Lady of North Farm, who lives in a cold, forbidding land that even the spooks find spooky. <br> <br> With her courageous (yet melancholy) kitty and a ragtag group of spectral friends she's picked up along the way, May is determined to escape the Afterlife. But first she must face her very worst fears, and there's no telling who will make it through...or who will be left behind.</p><p>Jodi Lynn Anderson is the bestselling author of several critically acclaimed books for young people, including <i>Tiger Lily</i> and the May Bird trilogy. She lives with her husband and son in Asheville, North Carolina, a city that appears to have been founded by elves.<p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><b>The World's Largest Demon Toenail and Other Wonders</b></p><p>On a train hurtling past a black sea, on a star far above the earth, a hairless cat lifted his nose to the air, sniffed, and let out a tiny howl. Even Somber Kitty didn't know why he did it. Instincts were weird that way.</p><p>He stared across train car 178 and let out a frustrated sigh. May, sitting at one of the car's windows, appeared to be lost in her own thoughts. Somber Kitty let his chin sink down onto his paws again.</p><p>May gently twirled the pendant Pumpkin had given her in the City of Ether -- one half of a tiny silver coffin that, when placed with its other half, showed the engraving: never to be dearly departed. She hardly blinked as she stared at the sight that had appeared on the horizon a few moments before.</p><p>Far above the vast, dark, oily Dead Sea that, May knew, held even darker things beneath its surface, dark clouds swirled. Strokes of lightning occasionally threaded their way across the sky, seeming to tie it in crooked bows. It looked like the world's worst thunderstorm was going on somewhere across the sea. Despite the distance, the sight fell over May's heart like a shadow.</p><p>May shivered and reached for Somber Kitty. Only too happy to oblige, the hairless cat -- who was considered very cute by some, very ugly by many others -- leaped into her lap, placed a paw on each of her shoulders, and licked her cheek with his sandpapery pink tongue. May scrunched up her face in disgust, but she smiled.</p><p>As she and Kitty peered out the window together, she thought of her mom, and the many strange and mysterious things that had happened to her since she had fallen into the lake in the West Virginia woods and come out on the wrong side of life, into the world of ghosts. The train slowly veered west, pulling away from the dark, glistening seashore, back into the Hideous Highlands, blanketed in dusk. In the Ever After, it was always dusk and the stars zipped through the sky as if they were meteors.</p><p>Decrepit old billboards -- like the ones they'd been seeing for the last few days -- zoomed past:</p><p>WORLD'S LARGEST DEMON TOENAIL, NEXT EXIT</p><p>PETEY'S PIRANHA SHACK: OUR PRICES CAN'T BE BEATEN, EVEN IF YOU'VE BEEN EATEN</p><p>THE HAIR STILL THERE SALON: DREAD LOCKS, SHRUNKEN HEAD MASSAGES, SCALP REATTACHMENT AVAILABLE</p><p>(DISCOUNT FOR THE FIRST 100 HOMESTEADERS TO MENTION THIS AD!)</p><p>They'd already passed the World's Largest Tombstone, the World's Longest String of Ectoplasm, several billboards promising a good time at the Poltergeist Corral, and several more announcing something called "The Carnival at the Edge of the World."</p><p>Sighing, May stood and moved forward through the opulent but decayed train car. In the first cabin she came to, Captain Fabbio's long, ghostly frame sprawled across two beds pushed together, neatly tucked under the sheets and snoring under his mustache.</p><p>Beatrice, in the cabin beyond, lay with one dainty, transparent arm splayed over a pile of books, the top of which was <i>Baedeker's Most Popular Destinations for Typhoid Victims</i>. May took the books, carefully marked their open pages, and put them on the bedside table, then quietly slid a pillow under her friend. Kitty, dangling rather close to Bea's face as May did this, touched her spectral cheek gently with his paw, then pulled back gingerly and licked his paw pads to warm them up.</p><p>May took his paw in her hand and blew on it warmly. Bea, like most spirits, was always so cold.</p><p>In the next cabin -- the one that May, Somber Kitty, and Pumpkin shared -- Pumpkin lay curled up around his blanket, snoring. Kitty did not even attempt to pat <i>Pumpkin's</i> cheek. He simply leaped from May's arms onto the top bunk. But every time a snore issued from the sleeping ghost's rather large, pumpkin-shaped head, he gazed down at him, then lifted his nose in the air and looked away.</p><p>At Pumpkin's request for her to "make it special," May had decorated the cabin like a royal Persian boudoir, scavenging moldy bolts of silk, shiny bells, star lights, and other decorations from various parts of the great train, deserted but for its skeleton conductor, who neither spoke nor reacted when May and her companions popped up to the front of the train to see him. Once the boudoir had been completed, Pumpkin had insisted on being called "Your Highness" whenever anyone in the room addressed him.</p><p>"Meow?" Somber Kitty whispered.</p><p>"All asleep," May said, misinterpreting Somber Kitty's question. What he had really meant was, <i>Are you sure you don't get the sense that someone we love is in danger?</i></p><p>At the moment May didn't sense anything. In fact, she was perfectly content. She had almost forgotten, just then, that she was stranded in the Afterlife, on a star a million miles from home. Friends, she had realized, could make you do that. Forget the things that worried you most. May had only just learned this; before the Ever After, her only friends had been cats.</p><p>It had been seven days since these very friends had helped her escape a fearsome creature called the Bogey at the City of Ether. Since then May had planned twenty-seven escape routes from the train in case it was stopped by their enemies. She had installed booby traps at the caboose of the train, as well as in the dining car -- involving string, empty slurpy soda cans, and some ectoplasm she'd found in the bathroom. She had even made scarecrows of herself, Pumpkin, Kitty, and the others to use in case of an emergency, though she didn't know how they would actually help. For less urgent reasons, she had also invented a mustache curler for Captain Fabbio, who liked to look dashing while he was on the run, and fashioned a clip to hold book pages down for Beatrice as she read.</p><p>For whatever reason, the Bogey was leaving May and her friends alone. He had to know exactly where they were. He had seen them leap onto the train. And it was a nonstop train straight to the north edge of the realm. May wondered if the Bogey had died when he'd been trampled by all those Egyptians outside Ether, but Bea had patiently reminded her that he had been dead in the first place. </p><p>May peered out her window into the distance again, as if she might see the object of these fears climbing up the sides of the train at any moment. Up ahead, the mountains of the Far North were visible, but just barely -- tiny points rising from the horizon and shrouded in a haze. The Hideous Highlands stretched endlessly between them -- a vast wasteland of ancient roadside curiosities.</p><p>Once, Bea had explained, the northern train route had been wildly popular among spirits all over the realm and had been populated with all manner of frontier towns and attractions. But for the past couple of hundred years it had declined to the point of extinction, until almost every train was empty and most of the attractions had shut down, fallen apart, and begun to disintegrate.</p><p>May sighed, then climbed onto the bunk beside Kitty to make her bed -- but she quickly shrank back.</p><p>A large manila envelope floated just an inch above the mattress, addressed:</p><p><i>May Ellen Bird</i></p><p><i>Car 178</i></p><p><i>The North Train</i></p><p><i>The Ever After</i></p><p>May looked around, hopped down off her bunk, checked the outside hallway, left and right, then climbed back onto the bed and gazed at Somber Kitty.</p><p>He blinked at her drowsily, his eyes green, lazy slits. If he had seen anyone deliver the strange package, he wasn't talking.</p><p>May touched the corner of the envelope with her pinky, pulled it toward herself, and turned it over.</p><p>She gasped. The stamp on the back was familiar. With her pinky, she traced the insignia of leaves shrouding a mysterious face. The only distinct feature visible was a pair of eyes, and they stared out at May with a look that was both inviting and sly -- enticing and, perhaps, dangerous. It was the same stamp that had been on the letter she'd received back in Briery Swamp, inviting her to the lake. The stamp of the Lady of North Farm.</p><p>After a moment's consideration May tugged the envelope open. A blinding light flew into her face and made her throw her hands in front of her eyes, shutting them tight. On the back of her eyelids, to her shock, these words were scrawled in bright white letters:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dear Miss Bird,</i></p><p><i>Congratulations on your narrow escape from the Bogey! The Lady is smiling on you -- but then, the Lady's smile can be very ambiguous.</i></p><p><i>We look forward to your arrival. The Lady has something she wants to ask of you. We understand that you have something to ask of her, too. In case you are wondering, she has it in her power to grant whatever you wish.</i></p></blockquote><p>May's heart skipped along a little faster. She thought immediately of home -- its shaggy green lawn and the wayward line of White Moss Manor's roof, the sagging porch, the shady woods. Wouldn't those things be a welcome sight? She pictured herself running up the stairs, through the front door, into the arms of her mom.</p><blockquote><p><i>We're sending you two freshly baked northern cookies and two bottles of grade A North Farm milk. They'll keep you from getting hungry or thirsty as long as you stay in the Ever After. You and your cat will need to consume them quickly. Please do not beat around the bush.</i></p></blockquote><p>May blinked her eyes open and looked into the pouch. She pulled out the cookies and milk, examining them in wonder, and laid them on her bed. When she shut her eyes again, more words appeared.</p><blockquote><p><i>Please hurry up. The Ever After is unraveling faster than an old sweater. Your enemies are not as close as you think, but they are closer than they should be. Speaking of which, you are about to hit a bump in the road. Good luck with that.</i></p><p><i>Never forget that the way back is forward.</i></p><p><i>Sincerely,</i></p><p><i>H. Kari Threadgoode</i></p><p><i>Secretary</i></p><p><i>P.S. The Lady wants me to say hello to Somber Kitty. Apparently, they go way back. Of course, being a cat -- and a living cat at that -- puts him in much danger.</i></p></blockquote><p>The letters on the backs of her eyelids f...</p></p><h2>Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Cell Phone and Sound Book: Calling All Pals</h2><p>The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Cell Phone and Sound Book: Calling All Pals comes with a toy cell phone that enables children to listen to messages from Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse as they follow along to a story about the popular Disney cartoon characters.

Married after only three months, young Theresa finds life with Adrian on the farm far more difficult and dangerous than she expected. Rejected by her husband&#39;s family as an outsider, she slowly learns for herself about the isolated world of farming, pesticides, environmental destruction, and death, even as she falls more deeply in love with her husband, a man she at first hardly knew and the land that has been in his family for generations. She becomes a reluctant player in their attempt to keep the codling moth from destroying the orchard, but she and Adrian eventually come to know that their efforts will not only fail but will ultimately take an irreparable toll.</p><p>This is a story about one farm, but it's also a story about every farm. It's a story about a nation and big business. It's a story about people not speaking up. It's a story about our children and our children's children. It's a story about acceptance of things that shouldn't be accepted. It's a story about a young girl who falls in love, marries an apple farmer, and never sees the world in the same way again. It's a story about one of the deepest and most profound loves of all: the love of a parent for a child.<br> &nbsp;<br> The main thing I set out to do with <i>The Orchard</i> was to document and capture a farming era in an anthropological yet very personal way. That was my number one goal. I never really wanted this book to be about me, or about one family. I wanted it to feel like every farm, and every family. I wanted it to be a parable. Which is why I used my name only once in the book. (I wouldn't have used it at all, but I didn't want readers to think I was Lily.) I didn't want to intrude upon a story that I didn't feel was my story, but was rather everybody's story.<br> Throughout the book, starting with the opening scene, there's this real lack of consideration for the next generation, for our children and our children's children. There's the acceptance of things that shouldn't be accepted. I wanted to drive home the fact that we are all responsible, and we are all important. &nbsp;<i>Theresa Weir</i><br> <br> &nbsp;An unforgettable story of struggle, resilience, and love in the American heartland, this book will forever change the way you think about farmers and family...<br> &nbsp;<br> At twenty-one, Theresa Weir falls in love with Adrian Curtis, the pride of a prominent local family whose lives and orchard are said to be cursed. Married after only three months, young Theresa finds life with Adrian on the farm far more difficult and dangerous than she expected. Rejected by her husband's family as an outsider, she slowly learns about the isolated world of farming even as she falls more deeply in love with her husband, a man she at first hardly knew.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>In an outcome that reflects the haunting realities of the landmark book SILENT SPRING</b>, the increasingly dangerous chemicals used on farms begins to take a tool on the land and the people who tend it. The couple's fragile love will be tested as Theresa and Adrian fight to defend ground that has been the family for generations.</p><h2>Giger&#39;s Alien</h2><p>Text and photographs trace the design and construction of the alien creature, and other special effects, from the motion picture</p><p></p><h2>Citizen Hearst: A Biography of William Randolph Hearst</h2><p>An exhaustive profile of the nation&#39;s most powerful newspaper mogul explores the life and times of William Randolph Hearst, his turbulent and flamboyant personal life, his controversial style of journalism, and the growth of his publishing empire.</p><p></p><h2>Marquetry &amp; Inlay: 18 Decorative Projects</h2><p>After a general introduction to tools and techniques, the authors show readers how to give a unique look to furniture, wooden toys and games, jewel boxes, tiles, and many other household items.

This was Annie Proulx&#39;s first novel.</p><p>Reproduced as graphics that preface narrative sections, the postcards in this novel -- communications between the Blood family and their son Loyal, as well as other personal mail and advertising material -- progressively reveal the insecurity of the rural Bloods in the changing post-war world. Loyal has fled into exile after an accidental killing, but cannot find a haven of rest. The family patriarch, Mink, writes vitriolic letters to local agricultural agents when the real object of his ire is his absent son. Loyal&#39;s brother sends off for an artificial arm to replace the one he lost in an accident; his sister answers a mail order ad for a husband. Through the mail, Proulx inventively reveals the inchoate longings of a difficult existence in this winner of the 1993 PEN/Faulkner Award.<b>E. Annie Proulx</b> lives in Wyoming, but spends much of the year traveling North America. She has held NEA and Guggenheim Fellowships and residences at Ucross Foundation in Wyoming. Her short story collection, <i>Heart Songs and Other Stories,</i> appeared in 1988, followed in 1992 by <i>Postcards,</i> which won the 1993 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. The 1993 novel The <i>Shipping News</i> won the <i>Chicago Tribune's</i> Heartland Award, the <i>Irish Times</i> International Fiction Prize, the National Book Award, and the Pulitzer Prize. <i>Accordian Crimes,</i> Proulx's most recent novel, was published in June 1996.</p><h2>Omar Bradley: General at War</h2><p><b>The First In-Depth Biography of America&#x2019;s Last Five-Star General</b><br><br>He was known as &#x201c;the G.I. General&#x201d;&#x2014; humble, self-effacing, hard-working, reflecting the small-town virtues of the America whose uniform he wore. But those very virtues have led historians to neglect General Omar Bradley&#x2014;until now. Bestselling author Jim DeFelice, in this, the first-ever in-depth biography of America&#x2019;s last five-star general, tells Bradley&#x2019;s full story, and argues that the neglected G.I. General did more than any other to defeat Hitler in World War II.<br><br>While General George S. Patton has garnered much of the glory, General Dwight David Eisenhower has claimed much of the world&#x2019;s respect, and British General Bernard Montgomery has kept the Union Jack flying, as DeFelice proves, it was the unassuming Bradley who actually developed the strategy and the tactics that won the war in Europe.

Through the pages of this fast-paced and thoroughly researched story, the crack shot from Middle America emerges as an intellectual force behind some of America's greatest victories--and a man who held his own against titans like Eisenhower, Patton, and Montgomery. From the deserts of Tunisia to the blood-stained snows of Bastogne, DeFelice's saga of war, heroism, and humility gives America's last five-star general a literary monument he never had in life. <i>Omar Bradley: General at War</i> is a truly remarkable book you'll enjoy for its skillful writing as well as its historical credibility. Highly recommended!"<br><b>--Jonathan W. Jordan</b>, bestselling author of <i>Brothers, Rivals, Victors: Eisenhower, Patton, Bradley and the Partnership that Drove the Allied Conquest in Europe</i> <p></p>"Jim DeFelice has written an entertaining and readable account of a great leader's life, showing what shaped his character and how he faced some of the greatest military challenges of the twentieth century.

Crossing religious and geographic boundaries, this is a story about family, commitment, loss and love, sacrifice and survival.

On the way to Jr. Island, the parts of their car decide to quit doing their jobs. Will the little girl and her father ever make it to Jr. Island? Will the car parts ruin everyone&#39;s day? Will they learn a lesson about working together? This challenging and entertaining book will help your children realize that no matter who they are, they will always have really important parts to play in life.</p><p>Once in a generation, a comedian comes along who speaks to everyone. Today, that comedian is known simply as Michael Jr. Imagine a line from Bugs Bunny to Bill Cosby and you ll have an idea of Michael s influences. Watch him onstage and you ll see a man at ease...with himself, his audience, and his message. Listen to his voice and you ll detect a comfortable, conversational style that hides a sly sense of mischief. Hear his words and you ll laugh at the universal themes that connect us all. Michael s entry into comedy was almost preordained. Years ago in a crowded Grand Rapids, Michigan movie theater, the projector malfunctioned. The film snapped, the house lights came on, and acting on a dare, young Michael jumped in front of the restless crowd and took center stage. When the theater manager tried to usher him out, the audience demanded he stay...and Michael Jr. discovered his gift. Comedian George Wallace offered Michael his first break when he took him to the legendary Comedy &amp; Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, home of Jay Leno and The Tonight Show staff. The club s owner slipped Michael onstage...and a week later Michael was performing at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal, where he became the first comedian to ever appear live via satellite on The Tonight Show. That performance catapulted Michael s career and has resulted in additional appearances on The Tonight Show, Comedy Central, The Late, Late Show, BET, Jimmy Kimmel Live, SiTV, The Byron Allen Show, and any more. You ll also find him at the most prestigious comedy clubs across he nation, including The Improv, The Laugh Factory, The Comedy Store, The Punchline, The Comic Strip, and Zany s. If that weren t enough, Michael s versatility takes him from major universities such as Notre Dame, the University of Massachusetts, and the University of Alabama, to church events ranging from the 60,000 member Willow Creek Church in Chicago to the 17,000 member West Angeles Church in L.A. And now, you can see him in Thou Shalt Laugh, a comedy DVD released by Warner Bros.</p><h2>Jimmy Stewart: The Truth Behind The Legend</h2><p>This is the definitive biography of a man who became one of the silver screen&#39;s enduring legends.</p><p><b>Michael Munn</b> is a film historian and the author of twenty-five books, including<i>Stars at War</i>, <i>The Hollywood Connection</i>, <i>Richard Burton</i>, and the bestseller<i>John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth</i>. As a journalist, he has written extensively on cinema, crime, ancient history, and World War II. He lives in Suffolk, England.<br>Ask a younger audience about Gary Cooper or Spencer Tracy, and you might get a blank stare. Jimmy Stewart, thanks to It&#x2019;s a Wonderful Life, hasn&#x2019;t suffered the same fate. Stewart&#x2019;s fans are in for a treat with this anecdote-filled biography, which features a major bombshell: for years, Stewart provided undercover reports to the FBI&#x2019;s J. Edgar Hoover. Among the nuggets mined here: the rift over politics between conservative Stewart and his liberal best friend, Henry Fonda; Stewart being tempted by Grace Kelly; and how Stewart wanted to help Hoover rout the Mafia from Hollywood but ended up naming Communists. Unfortunately, these revelations and the text as a whole could have been better documented. Appended is a list of sources, but as Munn, a friend of both Stewart and Stewart&#x2019;s wife, Gloria, testifies, it&#x2019;s limited to &#x201c;who I&#x2019;ve quoted . . . along with the year (as best I can remember it)&#x201d; and the location. Much of the information comes from phone calls and social chats with Gloria Stewart. Did Munn really write everything down? Still, shaky bona fides aside, this a fun Old Hollywood bio. --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>Building Writing Skills Level 1 Workbook - Using a 5-Step Writing Process to Teach Writing (Grades 3-5)</h2><p>This highly-effective 96-page book teaches narrative (personal and story), opinion, and informative/explanatory writing as a 5-step process.

These works are rarely shown together, and in fact cannot be seen in their entirety, since one of them exists only in fragments, but the three intact paintings and the surviving elements of the fourth are reproduced in this publication, and will be shown at The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition in the fall of 2006. Maximilian's death was an event of great public interest in France, in part because French policies shared the responsibility for it. A European aristocrat of the Hapsburg family, Maximilian had been installed in 1864 after a trio of European powers, led by Napoleon III of France, mounted an invasion of Mexico to reclaim debts upon which the Mexican government had suspended payment. But Napoleon soon withdrew, abandoning Maximilian to his fate at the hands of a resurgent Mexican army. As news of the execution reached Paris, Manet reacted with a group of works synthesizing the information as it came to him and drawing heavily on an earlier painting inspired by violent political events, Goya's <i>The Third of May.</i> In addition to analyzing and documenting the creation of these works, John Elderfield, in his text, clarifies their historical importance in the context of modern art, and in so doing, offers a capsular history of the place of current events in art.</p><p></p><h2>Butterflies and Skippers of Ohio (BULLETIN OF THE OHIO BIOLOGICAL SURVEY NEW SERIES)</h2><p>x + 212 pp including appendices, bibliography, glossary, indices and plates, history of butterfly study and research in Ohio, includes Hesperiidae, Papilionidae, Pieridae, Lycaenidae, Riondinidae, Libytheidae, Heiconiidae, Nymphalidae, Apapturidae, Satyriadae, Sanaidae, butterlies erroneiously reported from Ohio, color plates of butterflies</p><p></p><h2>Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy</h2><p><p><b>A GoodReads Reader's Choice<br><br>Bridget Jones&#x2014;one of the most beloved characters in modern literature (v.g.)&#x2014;is back!

The one I had a snog with?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; I said trying vaguely to remember which one.<br><br> &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t call. And then last night, he copied me in on a global text saying his wife has just had a baby girl 6 lbs 12 oz.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;OhMyGod. That&#x2019;s disgusting. That&#x2019;s inhuman.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All these years I didn&#x2019;t want children and people kept saying I&#x2019;d change my mind. They were right. I&#x2019;m going to get my eggs unfrozen.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Jude,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You made a choice. Just because some guy is a fuckwit it doesn&#x2019;t mean it was the wrong choice. It&#x2019;s a good choice for you. Children are . . . are . . . &#x201d; I glanced murderously back down the stairs.<br> She held out her phone showing an Instagram picture of the Fuckwit holding his baby.<br><br> &#x201c;. . . cuddly and lovely and pink and 6 lbs 12 oz and all I do is work and hook up and I&#x2019;m all on my own on a Saturday morning. And. . . . &#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Come downstairs,&#x201d; I said, darkly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show you cuddly and lovely.&#x201d;<br><br> We clomped back down. Billy and Mabel were now standing cherub-like, holding out a drawing saying, &#x201c;We Love You Mummy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to empty the dishwasher, Mummy,&#x201d; said Billy. &#x201c;To help you.&#x201d;<br><br> Shit! What was wrong with them?<br><br> &#x201c;Thank you, children. That would be lovely,&#x201d; I purred, bustling Jude back upstairs, and outside the front door, before they did something worse like emptying the recycling bin.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to defrost the eggs,&#x201d; sobbed Jude as we sat down on the steps. &#x201c;The technology was primitive then. Crude even, but it might work if . . . I mean I could get a sperm donor and. . . . &#x201d; <br><br>Suddenly the upstairs window in the house opposite shot open and a pair of Xbox remotes hurtled out, landing with a smash next to the dustbins.<br><br> Seconds later, the front door flung open and the bohemian neighbor appeared, dressed in fluffy pink mules, a Victorian nightdress, and a small bowler hat, carrying an armful of laptops, iPads, and iPods. She teetered down the front steps and shoved the electronics in the dustbin, followed by her son and two more boys wailing, &#x201c;Noooooo! I haven&#x2019;t finished my leveeeeeeel!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good!&#x201d; she yelled. &#x201c;When I signed up for having children, I did NOT sign up to be ruled by a collection of inanimate thin black objects and a gaggle of TECHNO-CRACKHEADS refusing to do anything but stare with jabbing thumbs, while demanding that I SERVICE them like a computer tech crossed with a five-star-hotel concierge. When I didn&#x2019;t have you, everyone spent their entire time saying I&#x2019;d change my mind. And guess what? I&#x2019;ve had you. I&#x2019;ve brought you up. And I&#x2019;ve CHANGED MY MIND!&#x201d;<br><br> I stared at her, thinking, &#x201c;I have to be friends with that woman.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Children of your age in India live entirely successfully as street urchins,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;So you can just sit on that doorstep and instead of putting your ENTIRE BRAINS into getting to the next level on MINECRAFT, you can apply them to CHANGING MY MIND about letting you back in. And don&#x2019;t you dare touch that dustbin or I shall sell you to the HUNGER GAMES.&#x201d;<br><br>Then, with a toss of her bowler-hatted head, she flounced back into the house and slammed the door. <br><br>&#x201c;Mummeee!&#x201d; Shouting and crying erupted from my own basement. &#x201c;Mummeee!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Want to come back in?&#x201d; I said to Jude.<br><br> &#x201c;No, no, it&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; Jude said, happy now, getting to her feet. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re completely right. I have made the right choice. Just a bit hungover. I just need to have breakfast and a Bloody Mary at Soho House and read the papers and I&#x2019;ll be fine. Thanks, Bridge. Love you. Byee!&#x201d;<br><br> Then she teetered off in her Versace knee-length gladiator sandals, looking hungoverly fabulous.<br><br>I looked back across the street. The three boys were sitting in a line on the doorstep.<br><br> &#x201c;Everything all right?&#x201d; I said.<br><br> The dark-haired son grinned. &#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s fine. She just gets like this. She&#x2019;ll be all right in a minute.&#x201d;<br><br> He glanced behind him to check the door was still closed, and pulled an iPod out of his pocket. Then the boys started giggling, moved closer together, and bent over the iPod.</p><h2>Cobra</h2><p><b>A new heart-stopping thriller from internationally acclaimed crime writer Deon Meyer.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would a mathematics professor from Cambridge University, renting a holiday home outside Cape Town, require a false identity and 3 bodyguards? And where is he, now that they are dead? The only clue to the bodyguards' murder is the snake engraved on the shell casings of the bullets that killed them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigating the massacre, Benny Griessel and his team find themselves being drawn into an international conspiracy with shocking implications. It seems it is not just the terrorists and criminals of Britain and South Africa who may fear the professor's work, but the politicians too.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the body count begins to spiral viciously, Benny must put his new-found love life aside and focus on finding the one person who could give him a break in the case: a teenage pickpocket on the run in the city. But Benny is not the only person hunting for Tyrone Kleinbooi... <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relentlessly suspenseful, topical, hard-hitting and richly rewarding, <i>Cobra</i> is a superb novel from an author who is acclaimed around the world as a brilliant voice in crime fiction.</p><p>DEON MEYER was born in the South African town of Paarl in the winelands of the Western Cape in 1958, and grew up in Klerksdorp, in the gold mining region of Northwest Province. After military duty and studying at the Potchefstroom University, he joined <i>Volksblad</i>, a daily newspaper in Bloemfontein as a reporter. Before becoming a full-time crime author in 2009 he also worked as press liaison, advertising copywriter, creative director, internet strategist, and brand consultant. In 1994 he published his first Afrikaans novel. All later novels have been translated into 27 languages, including English, French, German, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Mandarin, Korean, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Russian, Finnish, Czech, Romanian, Slovakian and Bulgarian. The film rights of <i>Thirteen Hours</i> have been sold to an international production company, and most of his other novels have been optioned for movies. Meyer lives near Cape Town.<b><b>FINALIST 2015 &#x2013; CWA International Dagger Award</b><br><br></b>&#x201c;<i>Cobra</i> is Meyer's best book yet.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Die Burger</i><br><br>&#x201c;Meyer has an almost supernatural ability to know what is going to be topical.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Andries Wessels,&nbsp;<i>Beeld</i><br><br>&#x201c;It looks like a mob hit at a safe house on South African farmland, but maybe the murders and murderers are part of a wider global conspiracy somehow involving an English university computer genius privy to Edward Snowden&#x2013;scale government secrets. Deon Meyer&#x2019;s <i>Cobra</i> features cops, spies, academics, Soweto pickpockets and ordinary people just trying to get by. All cross paths in a fascinating look at modern South Africa and its multiracial relations, along with some of the snappiest dialogue you&#x2019;ll encounter these days. Read the glossary of multilingual terms at the back before you start to understand the best lines.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Winnipeg Free Press</i> <br><br>&#x201c;As if Police Captain Benny Griessel&#x2019;s life isn&#x2019;t fraught enough&#x2014;his advancing years, his AA regimen, his romance with a wealthy woman who&#x2019;s asking more of Benny than he can deliver&#x2014;he also draws a kidnapping-cum-murder case that has an international reach. Benny is the central character in South African writer Deon Meyer&#x2019;s series of novels, set in Capetown, that grow richer and more sophisticated with each new book. This progression makes <i>Cobra</i> the most dazzling of the bunch.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Toronto Star</i><br><br>&#x201c;[D]azzling.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jack Batten, <i>Toronto Star</i><br><br>&#x201c;Start the new year with a passel of spies, spooks and assassins, all spun from the clever mind of South Africa&#x2019;s best thrillermeister.&#x201d; &#x2014;Margaret Cannon, <i>The Globe and Mail</i><br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Meyer, the leading thriller writer in his native country, traffics in crime-novel situations familiar the world over: drunken cops, charming robbers, dangerous murderers, sudden violence&#x2014;and sometimes, issues of race. Mr. Meyer&#x2019;s South Africa, however, is unique. . . . Mr. Meyer&#x2019;s insider&#x2019;s view of a rapidly modernizing, multiracial South Africa will be unfamiliar to most U.S. readers.&#x201d; &#x2014;Steve Dougherty, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;An astonishing and violent climax. . . . Meyer gives rare insights into the texture of everyday life in a country still troubled 20 years after the release of Nelson Mandela.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Sunday Times</i> (South Africa)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Cobra</i> rattles along at a pleasing rate. When they come, the violent episodes have real impact. . . . [A] novel that&#x2019;s never less than readable. The South African setting is a major part of the appeal. Best of all, however, is Bernie himself, a humane recovering alcoholic riddled with self-doubt, and his interaction with his family, friends and colleagues. Long may he survive.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Spectator</i> (UK)<br><br>&#x201c;The plot clicks along like a machine, more cinematic than usual. . . . The set pieces, such as a complex train-hopping action sequence, are slickly executed. This is an author in full charge of his technique, but he burnishes the mechanics of the story with delicious Kaapse characters and richly idiomatic dialogue. . . . The feral pickpocket Tyrone Kleinbooi is one of Meyer&#x2019;s best characters ever, sly and quick with a strong sense of thieves&#x2019; honour. Meyer has a habit of beckoning side characters to the front of stage in subsequent books. . . . Here&#x2019;s hoping Meyer will put Mbali Kaleni centre stage in future. . . .&nbsp; More of Mbali, please, and more, much more of Deon Meyer.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michele Magwood, <i>The Sunday Times</i> (South Africa)<br><br>&#x201c;I really loved <i>Cobra</i>. . . . [It] has, I think, all the interest and excitement of Child 44 mixed with Day of the Jackal. It is a good suspenseful thriller, in other words, but includes the fascination of a fractured police team in a malfunctioning society. . . . I found this book really superb. An excellent holiday read, but worth reading when you get back too! . . .

Iliad, MT... Apollo, PA...), it is a memoir exploring the parameters of a heroic existence - by chronicling the lives of people in America's oft-ignored spaces, by examining the universal truths embedded in ancient myths, and by undertaking a fair bit of self-evaluation.

Stopping in classically named towns, he meets everyday heroes, including a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in Troy, Oregon; a modern-day hobo in Iliad, Montana; and a bomb-squad soldier in Sparta, Wisconsin.

Ken Follett-the master of suspense-follows his bestsllers with an extraordinary novel of the early days of World War II.</p><p>An old-fashioned tale of ordinary people thrown into the drama and danger of war, <i>Hornet Flight</i> is a rippingly good read. The time is 1941, and British bombers attacking Germany are being blown out of the sky in horrific numbers. How do the Nazis know they're coming? The answer is an infant technology called radar, and the Brits--with help from the Danish Resistance--must figure out how and where the German radar stations operate.<p> Follett, an old pro at World War II storytelling, vividly evokes the period, creating a sense not of historical re-creation but of urgently unfolding news. His cast of characters is memorable, including Harald Olufsen, a brainy 18-year-old pulled into the Resistance half against his will, and--typically for Follett--several central, well-drawn women. The plot does have some predictable elements: for example, from the time Harald first encounters a tiny wood-and-linen biplane called a Hornet Moth, half-rotted and stored away in a Danish barn, we know that it will heroically take to the skies. Then, when the very outcome of the war begins to turn on Harald getting a certain roll of film from Denmark to England, well... you can see where things are headed. But it's great fun to watch them develop, and Follett throws in just enough unexpected shocks to keep you off balance. Though it lacks the intensity of <i>Eye of the Needle</i>, Follett's finest and best-known book, <i>Hornet Flight</i> offers generous helpings of suspense and a climax that could hardly be more satisfying. <i>--Nicholas H. Allison</i></p>Ken Follett was only twenty-seven when he wrote Eye of the Needle, the award-winning novel which became an international bestseller and a distinguished film. Before that, he had been a newspaper reporter and a publishing executive after studying philosophy at University College, London.

Driskell: Artist and Scholar</h2><p>Chronicles the life of the artist, educator, and historian, covering his college years at Howard University, his personal life and career, and his artistic development.</p><p>*Starred Review* Driskell received no formal art training in either the one-room schoolhouse or the segregated high school he attended in North Carolina, but soon after he entered Howard University in 1949, his exceptional and versatile creativity began to flower. Driskell quickly set the foundation for a remarkably productive and influential life as an artist, educator, historian, curator, and humanitarian. In the first full inquiry into Driskell's life and work, art historian McGee analyzes with great empathy Driskell's philosophical struggles as he sought to both express his feelings about racial strife in America and stay true to his art. Influenced by Jack Levine, Romare Bearden, and a profound immersion in African art, Driskell is a master synthesizer, combining tradition with innovation in gloriously textured, color-saturated works of dazzling energy that embody both "introspection and playfulness." An ardent gardener, Driskell has turned to nature for inspiration, especially trees, and believes that "art is both palliative and priestly." With an abundance of incandescent reproductions of Driskell's searching and vital work, photographs documenting his life, and multifaceted and involving commentary, this unprecedented volume extends the reach of a great artist and tireless arts advocate. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Modern interpreters of the Bible questioned this premise. But in recent decades, a critical mass of theologians and biblical scholars has begun to reassert the priority of a theological reading of Scripture.<br><br>The Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible enlists leading theologians to read and interpret Scripture for the twenty-first century, just as the church fathers, the Reformers, and other orthodox Christians did for their times and places. In this addition to the series, esteemed theologian Robert W. Jenson presents a theological exegesis of Ezekiel.</p><p><b>Praise for previous volumes in the Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible<br></b><br>"The significance of these commentaries and the series [they] inaugurate [is] manifold, because they promise not only to serve as a means for sifting the wheat and chaff of much recently accumulated hermeneutical theory but also to offer the commentary a place at the theological table it has had difficulty attaining in modernism. . . . [<i>Acts</i>] is a tour de force of the history of doctrine, as [Jaroslav] Pelikan draws in his lifetime to remark upon a vast panoply of subjects."--<b>Steven J. Koskie</b>, <i>Journal of Theological Interpretation<br></i><br>"[Peter] Leithart does an eminently satisfying work of exposition. . . . [<i>1 &amp; 2 Kings</i> is] stimulating in its unabashedly theological interpretive stance. Such a starting point for the exegetical task inquires differently of the text and renders fresh applications and observations. The two disciplines of biblical and theological studies can only benefit from cross-disciplinary engagement and, certainly, Leithart demonstrates that both disciplines can be used critically and in service of the Church."--<b>Lissa M. Wray Beal</b>, <i>Toronto Journal of Theology<br><br></i>"In [<i>Matthew</i>], there is substantial discussion of a whole host of issues that are of profound importance to Christians. . . . The commentary is the work of one capable of acute observation and profound thought. At his best [Stanley] Hauerwas shows some real sensitivity to Matthew's story telling technique. . . . There is certainly much to challenge and inspire Christian readers."--<b>John Nolland</b>, <i>Review of Biblical Literature<br><br></i>"Preachers will . . . find considerable assistance and rich theological material in <i>Leviticus</i>. . . . With this volume, [Ephraim Radner] makes a serious contribution to biblical scholarship."--<i>Preaching</i>The Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible enlists leading theologians to read and interpret scripture creedally for the twenty-first century, just as the church fathers, the Reformers, and other orthodox Christians did for their times and places. <i>Ezekiel</i>, like each commentary in the series, is designed to serve the church--through aid in preaching, teaching, study groups, and so forth--and demonstrate the continuing intellectual and practical viability of theological interpretation of the Bible.<br><br>"Robert Jenson brings to the interpretation of Ezekiel years of theological study, a deeply trinitarian vision, and an ability to read the Bible as Christian scripture. That combination vivifies the dry bones of much standard biblical exegesis and illumines what is surely one of the strangest of biblical books."--<b>Gilbert Meilaender</b>, Valparaiso University<br><br>"Here is a faithful Christocentric reading of Ezekiel that sits happily alongside this Jewish reader's cherished volume of Moshe Greenberg's commentary on Ezekiel. Jenson's Christocentric reading is also a deep reading of this text, drawing up dimensions of form and force and meaning that will also serve the rabbinic reader: not because of any leveling or syncretism, but because, once drawn up, these dimensions may then be drawn forward in their different ways by the differing communities of rabbinic and Christian readers."--<b>Peter Ochs</b>, University of Virginia<br><br>General editor: <b>R.

A young Indian girl, Looks Within, begins a spiritual journey guided by Wisdom Keeper. The older woman teaches by bringing attention to things in nature that correspond to each letter of the alphabet. Dragonflies with light shining on their wings remind her of the light from the Creator. Lizard protects people from harm by dragging his tail on the ground to erase footsteps. The letter X, tricky for all alphabet books, symbolizes a crossroads where choices must be made. Unique in bringing Indian women and girls front and center, this amazing work combines spiritual lessons, narrative, and vibrant artwork. Bold acrylics, flooded with color, form, simplicity, and subtlety, fill each page. Stroud, of Cherokee-Creek birth, draws also on the Kiowa traditions in her adopted family. In a prefatory note, she suggests that the philosophy shared by all Indian peoples is available to everyone. The path of the quiet elk "...is not a place, but a way of learning to look at life." Byrd Baylor's poetic Desert Voices (1981) and I'm in Charge of Celebrations (1986, both Scribners) compare to this title in heart, but The Path of the Quiet Elk is one-of-a-kind. It looks like an easy picture book, but offers readers something much deeper.?Jacqueline Elsner, Athens Regional Library, GA<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.While accompanying the tribal elder Wisdom Keeper on a woodland walk, a Native American girl named Looks Within discovers that the path they follow is "not a place, but a way of learning to look at life." A playful otter is "a reminder not to worry about life, but to let it unfold"; a hummingbird hints at life's "sweetness" and how "to spread it." The journey yields souvenirs both practical (an antler for a necklace) and metaphorical (a seashell that "will bring you rhythm, like the waves that slowly moved in and out of it"). On the path, animals, artifacts and concepts appear in alphabetical order, from Animal Helper to Zest, lending structure to this melange of wisdom without distraction. Cherokee-Creek by birth and adopted into a Kiowa family, Stroud (A Walk to the Great Mystery; Doesn't Fall Off His Horse) writes a sound, sturdy if didactic text.

In this book Tim Mackintosh-Smith follows the first stage of Ibn Battutahs journey, from Tangier to Constantinople. Destinations include an Islamic Butlins in the Egyptian desert, Assassin castles in Syria, the Kuria Maria Islands in the Arabian Sea and some of the greatest cities of Medieval Islam. He also cleverly compares the contemporary Muslim world with the past.</p></p><p>In 1325, the great Arab traveler Ibn Battutah set out from his native Tangier in North Africa on pilgrimage to Mecca. By the time he returned nearly thirty years later, he had seen most of the known world, covering three times the distance allegedly traveled by the great Venetian explorer Marco Polo&#x2014;some 75,000 miles in all. <br><br>Captivated by Ibn Battutah&#x2019;s account of his journey, the Arabic scholar and award-winning travel writer Tim Mackintosh-Smith set out to follow in the peripatetic Moroccan&#x2019;s footsteps. Traversing Egyptian deserts and remote islands in the Arabian Sea, visiting castles in Syria and innumerable souks in medieval Islam&#x2019;s great cities, Mackintosh-Smith sought clues to Ibn Battutah&#x2019;s life and times, encountering the ghost of &#x201c;IB&#x201d; in everything from place names (in Tangier alone, a hotel, street, airport, and ferry bear IB&#x2019;s name), to dietary staples to an Arabic online dating service&#x2014; and introducing us to a world of unimaginable wonders. <br> <br>By necessity, Mackintosh-Smith&#x2019;s journey may have cut some corners (&#x201c;I only wish I had the odd thirty years to spare, and Ibn Battutah&#x2019;s enviable knack of extracting large amounts of cash, robes and slaves from compliant rulers.&#x201d;) But in this wry, evocative, and uniquely engaging travelogue, he spares no effort in giving readers an unforgettable glimpse into both the present-day and fourteenth-century Islamic worlds.TIM MACKINTOSH-SMITH was studying Arabic at Oxford when he first visited Yemen and became obsessed with the place and its language. He has lived there since 1982. His first book, YEMEN: THE UNKNOWN ARABIA, won the Thomas Cook/Daily Telegraph Travel Book Award and was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year in 2000.</p><h2>Eve&#39;s War: The diaries of a military wife during the second world war</h2><p><p><b>THE DIARIES OF A MILITARY WIFE DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR</b></p><p>In <b>1935</b>, Evelyn Shillington started a diary, little knowing the years of turmoil it would cover, and how insightful her experiences as an army wife would be to the following generations.</p><p>Eve joined her beloved husband, Captain Rex Shillington, on his postings, giving her a unique view into army life.

Spurred by a complex web of motivations&#x2014;shame, familial obligation, and sometimes even greed&#x2014;more than a million people attempted to flee the Irish famine. More than one hundred thousand of them would die aboard one of the five thousand aptly named &#x201c;coffin ships.&#x201d; But in the face of horrific losses, a small ship named the <i>Jeanie Johnston </i>never lost a passenger. Shipwright John Munn, community leader Nicholas Donovan, Captain James Attridge, Dr. Richard Blennerhassett, and the efforts of a remarkable crew allowed thousands of people to find safety and fortune throughout the United States and Canada. <br><br>Why did these individuals succeed when so many others failed? What prompted them to act, when so many people preferred to do nothing&#x2014;or worse? Using newspaper accounts, rare archival documents, and her own experience sailing as an apprentice aboard the recently re-created <i>Jeanie Johnston, </i>Kathryn Miles tells the story of these extraordinary people and the revolutionary milieu in which they set sail. The tale of each individual is remarkable in and of itself; read collectively, their stories paint a unique portrait of bravery in the face of a new world order. Theirs is a story of ingenuity and even defiance, one that recounts a struggle to succeed, to shake the mantle of oppression and guilt, to endure in the face of unimaginable hardship. On more than one occasion, stewards of the ship would be accused of acting out of self-interest or greed. Nevertheless, what these men&#x2014;and their ship&#x2014;accomplished over the course of eleven voyages to North America was the stuff of legend. <br><br>Interwoven in their tale is the story of Nicholas Reilly, a baby boy born on the ship&#x2019;s maiden voyage. The Reilly family climbed aboard the <i>Jeanie Johnston </i>in search of the American Dream. While they would find some version of that dream, it would not be without a struggle&#x2014;one that would deposit Nicholas into a deeply controversial moment in American history. Against this backdrop, Miles weaves a thrilling, intimate narrative, chronicling the birth of a remarkable Irish-American family in the face of one of the planet&#x2019;s greatest human rights atrocities.</p><p><b>Kathryn Miles </b>serves as writer-in-residence for Green Mountain College. She lives with her family in Portland, Maine.<b>PROLOGUE</b><br><br>Fergus Falls, Minnesota<br> <br>Friday, August 27, 1883<br> <br><i>On most evenings, a steady stream of patrons crossed the Red River footbridge to have a drink at James K. O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s saloon. But not that night.</i><br> <br><i>The Sullivan Troupe&#x2019;s Irish Revue was in town for one night only, and everybody who was anybody already had a ticket. That meant business was slow at O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s Saloon in the Grand Hotel. All evening its lone bartender, Nicholas Reilly, stood at his post between the shelves of spirits and the glistening new bar, watching as residents of Fergus Falls paraded up Lincoln Avenue, dressed for the show in their Sunday best.</i><br> <br><i>Two blocks away, Nicholas&#x2019;s wife, Cecilia, tended to their two young children, William and Helen. Somewhere on a floor above him, Nicholas&#x2019;s younger brother, Eugene, was settling into one of the small rooms O&#x2019;Brien set aside for borders. It was a good night to be inside.</i><br> <br><i>A steady and unexpectedly cold rain dotted the saloon windows and puddled in the street, but the townspeople seemed impervious. The Sullivan Troupe&#x2019;s vaudeville act was the biggest event to visit the Red River Valley; no one worth his salt was willing to miss it, even if doing so meant ruining a taffeta dress. All of Fergus Falls, it seemed, had suddenly contracted a whopping case of Irish fever.</i><br> <br><i>Twenty-five years had passed since the Great Hunger had claimed the lives of a million Irish people and forced a million more onto North America&#x2019;s shores, forever marking the famine as one of the greatest human rights atrocities in recorded history. Since that time the United States had formed a complicated relationship with its new Irish brethren,</i> <i>based alternately on pity, curiosity, contempt, and, most often, a thorny combination of all three. The Sullivan Revue capitalized on that complexity, promising an evening of historic lectures, romantic ballads, and side-splitting satire.</i><br> <br><i>Everyone was on their way to the show that night, and yet, oddly, Jim O&#x2019;Brien&#x2014;the saloon&#x2019;s owner and Fergus Falls&#x2019; most prominent Irish resident&#x2014;was nowhere to be found. His absence was inexplicable to most people in town, but not to the saloon&#x2019;s young bartender. Nicholas was growing accustomed to O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s mysterious disappearances, although that didn&#x2019;t make him overly comfortable with them. Truth be told, Nicholas wasn&#x2019;t comfortable with much about his brother-in-law.</i><br> <br><i>Since opening that summer, O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s Saloon had become the unofficial epicenter of town activity; on most nights, a never-ending chorus of shouted drink orders added to the din already created by well-used billiard tables and one of the only full-size pianos in town. Nicholas liked the frenetic pace required to keep up with all the activity, and the bar was doing well&#x2014;that much was obvious every night when he emptied the cash register before crossing the street to join Cecilia in the cramped apartment they shared with Jim and his family. But even with the overflowing till, Nicholas was hard-pressed to account for the purchase of this massive brick hotel. And then there was the inexplicably large stack of money and whiskey bonds in the saloon&#x2019;s brand-new safe, which was almost as enormous as Jim O&#x2019;Brien himself.</i><br> <br><i>Nicholas knew he would have to get to the bottom of these puzzles&#x2014;and that the future of his family would no doubt be better without Jim O&#x2019;Brien in it. But tonight his thoughts, like those of his fellow towns-people, were all about Ireland. As he watched people hurrying toward the theater, he cast his mind back to a place he never really knew.</i><br> <br><i>Hardly any of the passersby bothered to look inside the saloon&#x2019;s rain-smeared windows. Even fewer paused for a pint before heading to the show. That was really too bad. Had anyone stopped long enough to chat with the young man standing behind the bar, they would have been treated to a story worth far more than the admission being paid at Gray&#x2019;s Hall.</i><br> <br><i>Nicholas, after all, was more Irish than the Sullivans and O&#x2019;Briens put together. However, as he was always quick to explain, he wasn&#x2019;t really</i> <i>from there. Nicholas Reilly was born at sea, and he made a point of stating that fact on every document, governmental or otherwise, that asked for his place of birth. He also listed his legal name as Nicholas Johnston Reilly on such papers, but that was really just for convenience&#x2019;s sake. His full name, he liked to say, was Nicholas Richard James Thomas William John Gabriel Carls Michael John Alexander Trabaret Archibald Cornelius Hugh Arthur Edward Johnston Reilly, so named for the owner, doctor, and crew of the</i> Jeanie Johnston, <i>the legendary famine ship on which Nicholas was born thirty years earlier.</i><br> <br><i>That he was born on Easter Sunday, the very day the vessel was scheduled to embark from County Kerry on her first refugee voyage, was noteworthy enough. That he and his family survived the arduous journey that followed was nothing short of astounding. Mortality rates on the aptly named coffin ships could be as high as 70 percent.</i><br> <br><i>Not so on the</i> Jeanie Johnston. <i>Beginning with the much publicized announcement of Nicholas&#x2019;s birth, this little square-rigged barque was known far and wide as a charmed ship&#x2014;the only coffin ship, in fact, to keep all of her passengers alive. And with each of her eleven successful trips to North America, the reputation of this vessel continued to grow. Soon it was said around the world that to sail aboard the</i> Jeanie Johnston <i>was to survive despite crushing odds.</i><br> <br><i>Aboard the</i> Jeanie Johnston, <i>these odds would spur people like the Reillys and their crew to travel thousands of miles from home in search of a new beginning. These odds would demand that they risk their lives at every turn. More than once it would force them to flout naval law and invite arrest&#x2014;or worse. And yet the sterling record of the barque and her occupants would stand, their mythology building with each subsequent year, eventually making them luminary figures in one of the most calamitous moments in history.</i><br> <br><i>The epic story of survival on the</i> Jeanie, <i>and how Nicholas Richard James Thomas William John Gabriel Carls Michael John Alexander Trabaret Archibald Cornelius Hugh Arthur Edward Johnston Reilly came to be born on it, was a story so fantastic that not even the world-renowned Sullivan Troupe Irish Review dared tackle it. It would take over a century of study and discussion prompted by marine architects,</i> <i>naval historians, and the leaders of nations to tease out the story of Nicholas and his namesake vessel. In the intervening years, many refugees who sailed aboard would call the</i> Jeanie <i>miraculous and her builder, owner, and crew saviors. Historians would puzzle over why this ship&#x2014;and this ship alone&#x2014;managed to keep all of her passengers alive. Medical and nautical officials would study and eventually revolutionize sailing procedures as a result of her accomplishment. Critics would accuse the men most closely associated with the ship of capitalizing on misery, of exploiting those desperate to travel by charging astronomical passage fees, of being no better than human traffickers. They would speculate about the demons and guilt driving the vessel&#x2019;s historic course. And yet, for all that, they would all agree on one crucial truth: the story of the</i> Jeanie Johnston <i>is indisputably the stuff of legend.</i></p><h2>Swordspoint: A Novel</h2><p>In a nameless city where elegance and decadence coexist less than harmoniously, the great swordman Richard St Vier is forced to become involved in a plot to gain control of the city</p><p>forerunner to <b>The Fall of the Kings </b>now with three bonus stories.<b><br><br></b>Hailed by critics as &#x201c;a bravura performance&#x201d; (<i>Locus</i>) and &#x201c;witty, sharp-eyed, [and] full of interesting people&#x201d; (<i>Newsday</i>), this classic melodrama of manners, filled with remarkable plot twists and unexpected humor, takes fantasy to an unprecedented level of elegant writing and scintillating wit.

Getting caught in a tsunami is similar to being inside a giant washing machine. To avoid being caught in its waves one has to take drastic measures-and fast. The Digital Tsunami looks at how the shift from analog to digital is rapidly changing everything around us and the lessons this holds for a globalized world. The digital era is both compelling and frightening and will require us to change the way we work, our offerings, our mind-sets and ourselves. And nowhere is this change more necessary than in organizations and management techniques. Using the metaphor of a tsunami, the author explains how digitization is changing our world, what steps are necessary to adjust to it and just how to go about them. Timely and informative, this is the book you need in order to avoid being swept aside by the oncoming digital tsunami.</p><p></p><h2>STORY OF ART, THE</h2><p>This is an enlarged and updated introduction to the entire history of artistic creation from prehistoric paintings to the many varied experiments of our own time.

Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Susan Zuccotti teaches modern European history at Barnard College and Columbia University. She is the author of <i>The Italians and the Holocaust: Persecution, Rescue, and Survival</i> (Nebraska 1996), which won the National Jewish Book Award in 1987.In a vividly narrated reexamination of the historical record, Zuccotti (History/Barnard; Italians and the Holocaust, 1987) tells the horrifying story of the fate of French Jews at the hands of the Nazis and their Vichy collaborators. With its egalitarian legacy from the French Revolution, France was traditionally one of Europe's most enlightened societies in extending civil rights to Jews. But beneath this tradition, Zuccotti says, lay a deeper, more ancient one of anti-Semitism, which surfaced in modern times during the Dreyfus affair (1895) and at other moments of crisis for France. After its fall to Germany in 1940, France was divided into an occupied zone and the nominally independent Vichy Republic. In both regions, Zuccotti says, French bureaucrats and police cooperated with the Nazis in implementing laws to identify and segregate Jews--with French police, for example, interning Jews in camps established by Vichy officials in the unoccupied zone. In policies that affected both French and foreign Jews, the Nazis--with official French assistance--rounded up thousands in the occupied zone: Zuccotti emphasizes the terrifying roundup in Paris on July 16, 1942, which began the systematic deportation and destruction of Jews in France. By autumn 1942, those interned in the Vichy Republic were being delivered on a large scale to the Nazis. The author records disparate French attitudes toward the arrests, ranging from indifference or malicious satisfaction to sympathy and support for the victims. Indeed, French apathy (which contrasted with widespread, active anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe) may have been responsible for the relatively high survival rate (76 percent) of Jews in France. Zuccotti also dwells on the courage of relief organizations and of individual Protestant and Catholic workers (as opposed to many in the Church hierarchy, who supported Vichy) who hid and sheltered thousands throughout the country.

As the boy is wrenched from his father's arms, his mother collapses.&nbsp; The reason for his abduction: the boy had been secretly "baptized" by a family servant.&nbsp; According to papal law, the child is therefore a Catholic who can be taken from his family and delivered to a special monastery where his conversion will be completed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this terrifying scene, prize-winning historian David I. Kertzer begins the true story of how one boy's kidnapping became a pivotal event in the collapse of the Vatican as a secular power.&nbsp; The book evokes the anguish of a modest merchant's family, the rhythms of daily life in a Jewish ghetto, and also explores, through the revolutionary campaigns of Mazzini and Garibaldi and such personages as Napoleon III, the emergence of Italy as a modern national state.&nbsp; Moving and informative, <i>the Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara</i> reads as both a historical thriller and an authoritative analysis of how a single human tragedy changed the course of history.</p><p>Out of seemingly small events are sometimes born great historical moments. The case of young Edgardo Mortara is one. In 1858 the 6-year-old Jewish boy was taken from his parents&#39; home in Bologna, Italy, by agents of the Papal inquisition. The year before, seriously ill, Edgardo had been secretly baptized, by the Mortaras&#39; Catholic servant (or so she claimed); it was against the law for baptized Christians to be raised by Jews, and so, in the eyes of the Church, the kidnapping was only just. Secular Italians did not agree, and thus was set in motion a series of reforms that ended the Church&#39;s temporal power in Italy and forged the creation of a liberal, near-democratic state. For his part, young Edgardo became a priest and lived in a Belgian abbey until 1940--just before the invading Germans began to deport and execute all those tainted with Jewish blood. David Kertzer has shaped a remarkable narrative from almost forgotten events."National Book Award Finalist <br>Bologna, 1858: A police posse, acting on the orders of a Catholic inquisitor, invades the home of a Jewish merchant, Momolo Mortara, wrenches his crying six-year-old son from his arms, and rushes him off in a carriage bound for Rome. His mother is so distraught that she collapses and has to be taken to a neighbor's house, but her weeping can be heard across the city. With this terrifying scene--one that would haunt this family forever--David I. Kertzer begins his fascinating investigation of the dramatic kidnapping, and shows how the deep-rooted antisemitism of the Catholic Church would eventually contribute to the collapse of its temporal power in Italy. As Edgardo's parents desperately search for a way to get their son back, they learn why he--out of all their eight children--was taken. Years earlier, the family's Catholic serving girl, fearful that the infant might die of an illness, had secretly baptized him (or so she claimed). Edgardo recovered, but when the story reached the Bologna Inquisitor, the result was his order for Edgardo to be seized and sent to a special monastery where Jews were converted into good Catholics. His justification in Church teachings: No Christian child could be raised by Jewish parents. The case of Edgardo Mortara became an international cause celebre. Although such kidnappings were not uncommon in Jewish communities across Europe, this time the political climate had changed. As news of the family's plight spread to Britain, where the Rothschilds got involved, to France, where it mobilized Napoleon III, and even to America, public opinion turned against the Vatican. The fate of this one boy came to symbolize the entirerevolutionary campaign of Mazzini and Garibaldi to end the dominance of the Catholic Church and establish a modern, secular Italian state. A riveting story which has been remarkably ignored by modern historians--The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara will prompt intense interest and discussion as it lays bare attitudes of the Catholic Church that would have such enormous consequences in the twentieth century.</p><h2>Jane Eyre</h2><p>&#34;When it was first published in 1847, Jane Eyre was remarkable for its portrayal of a thinking, feeling woman who is rich in individuality and passionate in ther desire for a full life. And as contemporary readers the world over can attest, the novel has lost none of its fire. The story of Jane Eyre&#39;s metamorphosis from a frustrated, lonely orphan into a compassionate, self-confident, independent woman is a gripping one, made powerful by an elaborate plot that is purposefully executed and a writing style that is a s fiery and morally impressive as the novel&#39;s heroine. Jane herself reocunts the story of the physical and moral oppresion she endures as a child in the home of her hateful aunt and cousins, and later a the harsh boarding school she is sent to; of her employment as governess at Thornfield Hall, whose enigmatic owner, the gruff yet kind Edward Rochester, Jane finds fascinating; of the admiration and love that develops between them and that fate takes away; and of Jane&#39;s eventual evolution into a whole woman, after enduring poverty and isolation once more. Impressively, Charlotte Bronte succeeds in fully expressing Jan&#39;es character and in working out completely the themes that are so integral to her spirited heroine; love, independence, and forgiveness.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Power Sewing Step-by-Step</h2><p><p> </p><p><strong>Sewing is both a practical and a passionate pursuit, and Sandra Betzina's enthusiasm for sewing has won her a loyal following.

The shogun is old and ailing. Amid the ever-treacherous intrigue in the court, Sano Ichiro has been demoted from chamberlain to a lowly patrol guard. His relationship with his wife Reiko is in tatters, and a bizarre new alliance between his two enemies Yanagisawa and Lord Ienobu has left him puzzled and wary. Sano's onetime friend Hirata is a reluctant conspirator in a plot against the ruling regime. Yet, Sano's dedication to the Way of the Warrior&#x2015;the samurai code of honor&#x2015;is undiminished.</p><p>Then a harrowing, almost inconceivable crime takes place. In his own palace, the shogun is stabbed with a fan made of painted silk with sharp-pointed iron ribs. Sano is restored to the rank of chief investigator to find the culprit. This is the most significant, and most dangerous, investigation of his career. If the shogun's heir is displeased, he will have Sano and his family put to death without waiting for the shogun's permission, then worry about the consequences later. And Sano has enemies of his own, as well as unexpected allies. As the previously unimaginable death of the shogun seems ever more possible, Sano finds himself at the center of warring forces that threaten not only his own family but Japan itself.</p></p><p>LAURA JOH ROWLAND, the daughter of Chinese and Korean immigrants, was educated at the University of Michigan.

She lives in New York City.<p>1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;IT&#x2019;S A BAD night for a trip to the pleasure quarter,&#x201d; Detective Marume said.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good night when we&#x2019;re following up on the first lead we&#x2019;ve had in this investigation in more than four years,&#x201d; Sano said.</p> <p>They rode their horses along the Dike of Japan, the long causeway above the rice fields northeast of Edo. Metal lanterns swung from poles attached to their backs. On this winter night just after the New Year, they had the road to Yoshiwara to themselves. Their cloaks were drenched by sleet that lashed and stung their faces. Ice coated their metal helmets. Cold wind seeped through the heavy padding in Sano&#x2019;s cloak, under his armor tunic and his kimono. As sleet turned to snow, a veil of white crystals obscured the distance.</p> <p>&#x201c;How did you get us assigned to patrol the dike tonight?&#x201d; Marume asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t even have to try. You know the captain likes giving the worst assignments to the shogun&#x2019;s disgraced former chamberlain and second-in-command.&#x201d; Bitterness edged Sano&#x2019;s wry tone.</p> <p>In four years he&#x2019;d been demoted four times, from chamberlain down to patrol guard, the Tokugawa regime&#x2019;s lowest rank. His son, Masahiro, aged seventeen, was also a patrol guard, with no prospects for advancement, and their family had been evicted from their estate inside Edo Castle. It was a great humiliation for Sano, but he was lucky to have a position at all. For more than four years he&#x2019;d been pursuing a forbidden investigation, a thankless mission of honor.</p> <p>Marume laughed. &#x201c;He did us a favor without knowing it.&#x201d; The big samurai relished humor in any situation. &#x201c;How do you know our new suspects are in Yoshiwara tonight?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;An informer.&#x201d; Sano had bribed a servant of Lord Tokugawa Ienobu, the shogun&#x2019;s nephew and designated heir to the dictatorship.</p> <p>Ahead, Yoshiwara rose up from the rice fields, a city unto itself, the only place in Edo where prostitution was legal. Lights within its high walls made the falling snow above it glow like a halo. Sano and Marume rode across the moat to the gate where two sentries occupied a guardhouse. Moat, gate, and sentries were there to prevent troublemakers from entering the pleasure quarter and unhappy courtesans from escaping. The sentries opened the gate; Sano and Marume rode in.</p> <p>Naka-no-cho, the long main street that extended between rows of brothels, was almost empty. A few drunks stumbled to and fro. Snow frosted the tile roofs of the brothels; icicles grew between the red lanterns that hung from the eaves. Storm shutters covered the window cages where courtesans usually sat on display. Sano heard faint music played on samisens, flutes, and drums.</p> <p>&#x201c;The cold is keeping the customers at home,&#x201d; Marume said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Or the measles epidemic is.&#x201d;</p> <p>The epidemic had been raging across the country since autumn. It had come to Japan via Chinese priests visiting Nagasaki, the only place where foreigners were allowed. In Nagasaki some ten thousand people had died. Hundreds of people in Edo were sick. The disease was often but not invariably fatal. Here in Yoshiwara, as well as in town, incense burned outside doors to chase away the evil spirits of disease, and citizens feared contagion.</p> <p>&#x201c;Speaking of measles, how is the shogun?&#x201d; Marume asked. The shogun had come down with the measles just before the New Year.</p> <p>&#x201c;I hear he&#x2019;s recovering, but I haven&#x2019;t seen for myself,&#x201d; Sano said. He&#x2019;d been banned from court four years ago. That had been his punishment after the shogun had ordered him to stop the investigation and he&#x2019;d disobeyed. Sano had continued pursuing it for the good of the regime, to the detriment of his own career and domestic peace.</p> <p>He and his wife, Reiko, were seriously at odds over his actions. Long hours of patrol duty were a blessing for a man who didn&#x2019;t want to go home.</p> <p>&#x201c;So it looks like the shogun isn&#x2019;t going to die,&#x201d; Marume said with relief.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, but he&#x2019;s badly weakened. His health has always been frail, and he&#x2019;s sixty-three. Lord Ienobu is going to inherit the dictatorship sooner rather than later.&#x201d;</p> <p>That was why this new lead was so crucial.</p> <p>Sano and Marume turned their horses down one of the narrow lanes that crossed Naka-no-cho and stopped outside a small brothel. Laughter burst upon them as they peered through the window whose shutters were cracked open to clear out the smoke from charcoal braziers and tobacco pipes. A party occupied a room bright with lanterns. Young women as colorful as butterflies in their gay kimonos, their faces heavily made up and their hair spangled with ornaments, flirted with four samurai and plied them with sake.</p> <p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s who?&#x201d; Marume asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;The old fellow at the head of the table is Manabe Akira, Lord Ienobu&#x2019;s chief retainer.&#x201d;</p> <p>Manabe, in his late fifties, had a gray topknot and wore gray robes. His shaved crown and face were brown and shiny like an iron war mask from martial arts practice in the sun. He&#x2019;d been a top swordsman in his day. When a courtesan teased him, he responded with grunts.</p> <p>&#x201c;A real sociable type,&#x201d; Marume said.</p> <p>&#x201c;The men seated with their backs to us are Setsubara Ihei and Ono Jozan,&#x201d; Sano said. They were big and muscular, their kimonos fashionable with garish patterns, their black topknots slick with oil. They raised their cups in a toast. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re Manabe&#x2019;s aides.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The one across from them must have been a kid at the time of the murder.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Kuzawa Daimon, age nineteen. He&#x2019;s a guard.&#x201d;</p> <p>Kuzawa was as big and strong as Manabe&#x2019;s aides, and dressed like them, but his face and body had the softer look of youth. A courtesan stroked his beefy arm while telling him a joke. He laughed uproariously.</p> <p>&#x201c;Why do you think it&#x2019;s these men who killed the shogun&#x2019;s son?&#x201d; Marume asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yoshisato wasn&#x2019;t the shogun&#x2019;s son,&#x201d; Sano reminded him.</p> <p>&#x201c;I know. It&#x2019;s just easier to call him &#x2018;the shogun&#x2019;s son&#x2019; than &#x2018;the cuckoo&#x2019;s egg that Chamberlain Yanagisawa foisted off on the shogun.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p> <p>Six years ago, Yanagisawa had put Yoshisato, his own son, in line to inherit the dictatorship by proclaiming that Yoshisato was really the shogun&#x2019;s secret, long-lost son and he himself was only Yoshisato&#x2019;s adoptive father. Sano had tried to debunk the story and failed. The shogun believed it. So did enough top government officials and <i>daimyo</i>&#x2014;the feudal lords who ruled the provinces. The shogun had named Yoshisato as his successor, and Yanagisawa had been set to rule Japan through him and gain absolute power. But two years later, a fire set in the heir&#x2019;s residence had killed Yoshisato.</p> <p>Sano began the answer to Marume&#x2019;s question. &#x201c;Yoshisato&#x2019;s death cleared the way for Lord Ienobu to succeed the shogun, and we know Ienobu is responsible for the arson.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The woman who set the fire said he put her up to it, but she died right after confessing.&#x201d; Marume watched Manabe puff on his pipe. &#x201c;You think he helped Lord Ienobu set up Yoshisato&#x2019;s murder?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes. My informer says that shortly before the fire started, Manabe and the other three left Ienobu&#x2019;s estate. They didn&#x2019;t come back until the next day. They&#x2019;re the only people from the estate who were unaccounted for at the time of the murder.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But what part did they play in it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re going to find out. And then we&#x2019;ll have proof that Lord Ienobu is guilty of at least one murder.&#x201d;</p> <p>Sano already knew that Ienobu was responsible for the murder of the shogun&#x2019;s daughter. The culprit in that crime, also unfortunately dead, had implicated Ienobu. Sano wanted the proof as urgently as a starving man salivates for food. It wasn&#x2019;t just duty that compelled him to deliver Ienobu to justice and prevent a murderer from becoming the next shogun. Sano had liked Yoshisato even though he was Yanagisawa&#x2019;s son and Yanagisawa was Sano&#x2019;s longtime enemy. Sano wanted to avenge Yoshisato&#x2019;s death, and he had another, even more personal motive for bringing Lord Ienobu down. Ienobu was the one who&#x2019;d demoted Sano, as punishment for telling the shogun that Ienobu had murdered Yoshisato. The shogun didn&#x2019;t want to believe that his nephew and heir had murdered the man he thought was his son. He kept Sano in the regime, but Lord Ienobu constantly found ways to make life miserable for Sano.</p> <p>Manabe spoke in a gruff, peremptory voice to his subordinates. All four men drained their sake cups and headed for the door. Sano and Marume backed their horses into an alley, watched the men emerge from the brothel, then exited the gate behind them. Across the moat, the men retrieved their horses from a stable and attached lanterns on poles to their backs. They didn&#x2019;t notice Sano and Marume trailing them as they rode along the dike; patrol guards were ubiquitous, invisible. All Sano could see of them was their lights like swinging stars in the darkness. He was fifty years old, and his night vision was poor.</p> <p>A glow in the distance signaled that they were nearing Edo. Sano and Marume spurred their horses to a gallop. &#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; Sano called as he and Marume caught up with their quarries.</p> <p>The four men looked over their shoulders. Their lanterns threw arcing beams across the road. They reached for their swords as they turned their horses around, their expressions wary as they squinted through the snowflakes. Recognition appeared on Manabe&#x2019;s hard, shiny face.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sano-<i>san</i>.&#x201d; His gruff voice rasped with disapproval. &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d;</p> <p>At long last Sano was about to solve Yoshisato&#x2019;s murder and defeat Lord Ienobu. Apprehension coiled within his excitement: This was his one chance, a big risk. &#x201c;To talk with you four.&#x201d; Beside him, Marume put his hand to his sword.</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re supposed to stay away from us and everybody else in Lord Ienobu&#x2019;s retinue,&#x201d; Setsubara said. With his strong jaws, prominent nose, and sharp cheekbones, he was a caricature of masculinity.</p> <p>&#x201c;Those are Lord Ienobu&#x2019;s orders, and you know it.&#x201d; Ono&#x2019;s lumpy features reminded Sano of a bitter melon.</p> <p>Even as his heart raced, Sano spoke calmly. &#x201c;When you hear what I have to say, you&#x2019;ll be glad I disregarded those orders.&#x201d; He eyed Kuzawa. The young samurai looked nervous; he hadn&#x2019;t learned to hide his emotions.</p> <p>&#x201c;When Lord Ienobu hears that you&#x2019;ve disobeyed him, he&#x2019;ll have your head.&#x201d; Manabe jerked his chin at the other men. They all started to turn their horses.</p> <p>Sano said quickly, &#x201c;You four left his estate shortly before the fire in the heir&#x2019;s residence started. Isn&#x2019;t that an interesting coincidence?&#x201d;</p> <p>The four men went still. Sano focused on Kuzawa, whose eyes were wide, stricken. Seeing that he was right about the four men, Sano felt a rush of exhilaration.</p> <p>&#x201c;We went night fishing on the river,&#x201d; Manabe said in annoyance.</p> <p>&#x201c;Did you catch a big one?&#x201d; Detective Marume asked scornfully.</p> <p>&#x201c;We can vouch for each other,&#x201d; Ono said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Meaning, no one else can,&#x201d; Sano said. &#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t fishing. You were up to your necks in Yoshisato&#x2019;s murder.&#x201d;</p> <p>Manabe uttered a disgusted sound. Setsubara and Ono shook their heads, as if pitying Sano&#x2019;s foolishness. Detective Marume laughed and pointed at Kuzawa, who looked scared enough to wet his trousers. &#x201c;Whoops, your young friend as good as admitted you&#x2019;re guilty.&#x201d;</p> <p>Kuzawa ducked his head. Manabe said to Sano, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t prove anything.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wrong. I have evidence,&#x201d; Sano bluffed.</p> <p>&#x201c;What evidence?&#x201d; Ono asked disdainfully.</p> <p>&#x201c;The shogun will be first to know.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t be able to tell him anything.&#x201d; Contempt didn&#x2019;t quite mask Setsubara&#x2019;s worry. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re banned from court.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make sure the information is shouted by every news seller in Edo,&#x201d; Sano said. &#x201c;Soon it will be on the tongue of every samurai at the castle. It will reach the shogun eventually. He&#x2019;ll know you&#x2019;re as guilty as the woman who set the fire.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And then he&#x2019;ll have your heads,&#x201d; Marume added.</p> <p>Kuzawa gulped. Setsubara and Ono glared at him, but they looked scared, too. Manabe&#x2019;s hand tightened on his sword.</p> <p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re thinking of killing us to shut us up, forget it,&#x201d; Sano said. &#x201c;Other people know. If anything happens to us, they&#x2019;ll make the evidence public. You&#x2019;re going down for treason.&#x201d;</p> <p>The penalty for treason was death. The three subordinates looked anxiously to Manabe; he scowled. Sano urged his horse forward, advancing on them. &#x201c;But it doesn&#x2019;t have to be that way, if you confess that you arranged Yoshisato&#x2019;s murder on orders from Lord Ienobu.&#x201d;</p> <p>The four men looked stunned as they realized what Sano was after. Detective Marume clarified, &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t want your fat rear ends. He wants Lord Ienobu&#x2019;s skinny one.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Give me Lord Ienobu, and I&#x2019;ll see that you&#x2019;re pardoned,&#x201d; Sano said.</p> <p>He knew he was asking a lot from them. They owed their master their complete loyalty. That was Bushido, the Way of the Warrior, the samurai code of honor. And although the shogun was the lord over everyone in Japan, their ties to Ienobu were closer; they were his personal retainers. Anger darkened their faces as they comprehended that Sano was making them choose between dooming themselves and betraying Lord Ienobu, the ultimate sin.</p> <p>Manabe spoke through clenched teeth. &#x201c;We will not submit to blackmail. We will not help you destroy our master.&#x201d; The other men nodded.</p> <p>Sano had to break them, or heaven help him. &#x201c;Fine. Be good samurai. But don&#x2019;t expect Lord Ienobu to protect you when it comes out that you were involved in Yoshisato&#x2019;s murder.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll let you take the entire blame rather than admit you acted on his orders and be put to death along with you,&#x201d; Detective Marume said.</p> <p>That was Bushido, too: Loyalty didn&#x2019;t cut both ways. Emotions flickered across their faces as the four men stared down Sano and Marume. Sano detected fear, confusion, and something oddly sly in their expressions. The wind keened. The lantern&#x2019;s flames hissed as snowflakes hit them. In the instant that Sano realized what was going to happen, the four men drew their swords and charged.</p> <p>Sano and Marume barely had time to draw their own weapons before the men were upon them. Horses collided, whinnied, and reared. Sano lashed out. His sword cleaved falling snowflakes. The lanterns attached to his back and the other men&#x2019;s swung crazily. He glimpsed his opponents in flashes&#x2014;a red embossed breastplate; a chain-mailed arm; Ono&#x2019;s snarling face. Everything was dark except where the light momentarily touched. Sano&#x2019;s poor night vision put him at a serious disadvantage. His opponents flew at him out of nowhere. A blade struck his helmet, and the metallic clang shuddered his skull. He dodged and swung frantically. This was his first battle in more than four years. He practiced martial arts every morning, but real combat was different, not bound by rules, chaotic. And although Sano had won battles in which he was hugely outnumbered, he was older now. Maybe he could beat Manabe, but he couldn&#x2019;t outmatch the three younger samurai whose vision was sharper, reflexes quicker, and stamina greater.</p> <p>Marume yelled. Lights swung. In their path appeared a brief image of Marume covered with blood, arms thrown out, falling. Sano was horrified, and not just because Marume was his only ally tonight and among the few retainers he had left; he&#x2019;d discharged the others when he was demoted and his government stipend reduced. Marume had been his friend for twenty years. Heedless of his own safety, Sano leapt off his mount. He faltered through the tumult of hooves pounding and blades slicing at him, desperate to save Marume.</p> <p>Marume staggered up from the ground. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m all right!

At a historic moment when Irish republicanism is in the process of redefining itself, a highly-talented historian gives a compelling analysis of its past. The book&#39;s genius lies in its non-judgemental approach, an approach which has induced many leading republicans to speak more frankly to Richard English than they have done to any previous historian. This mixture of skilful historical research and totally new personal statements from key republicans makes this a captivating, authoritative and highly readable book.

Or sometimes the October War. The players that surround it are familiar: Sadat and Mubarak, Meir and Sharon, Nixon and Kissinger, Brezhnev and Dobyrnin. It was a war that brought Arab and Jew into vicious conflict. A war in which Israel almost unleashed her nuclear arsenal and set two superpowers on a treacherous course of nuclear escalation. <br><br>And a war that eventually brought peace. But a peace fraught with delicate tensions, disputed borders, and a legacy of further bloodshed.<br><br><i>The Two O'Clock War</i> is a spellbinding chronicle of the international chess game that was played out in October 1973. It is a story of diplomacy and military might that accounts for many of the dilemmas faced in the present-day Middle East.<br><br>This is a war that Israel never thought was possible. Surprised by the fury and excellent execution of the Arab onslaught, and perhaps more than a little complacent, Israel suddenly found itself on the point of losing a war because of a lack of ammunition, planes and tanks. The United States, after much vacillation, finally elected to help Israel, beginning a tremendous airlift (code name: Operation Nickel Grass) which incurred the wrath of the Arab states, and their sponsor, the Soviet Union. <br><br>Fortunately the airlift came just in time for Israeli ground forces to stabilize their positions and eventually turn the tide in the Sinai and Golan Heights. And it was all made possible by an operation that dwarfed the Berlin Airlift and the Soviets' simultaneous efforts in Egypt and Syria.<br><br><i>The Two O'Clock War</i> is bound to become the definitive history of a war that quite literally approached Armageddon.<br></p><p>In <i>The Two O'Clock War</i> Walter J. Boyne chronicles with intense detail the brief but furious October 1973 invasion of Israel by Egypt and Syria, an episode also known as the Yom Kippur War. Boyne alternates his attention between actual battlefield descriptions and the equally frantic maneuvering by diplomats and statesmen of the combatant countries, their allies. and, most ominously, Russia and the United States, which refused to stop rattling their sabers at each other. At least twice, the region--and by implication the greater world--came perilously close to suffering the ultimate nightmare: nuclear war. Boyne's language is often blunt but he is generally fair-minded: his showers of blame and praise fall on individuals on both sides of the conflict. Running through the book is his premise, convincingly presented, that a massive American airlift--Operation Nickel Grass--was the decisive factor in Israel's fending off defeat. The book--especially its military sections--demands a reader's full attention. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Walter J.

Wheeler (1882-1975) may have been the most powerful politician Montana ever produced, and he was one of the most influential&#x2014;and controversial&#x2014;members of the United States Senate during three of the most eventful decades in American history. A New Deal Democrat and lifelong opponent of concentrated power&#x2014;whether economic, military, or executive&#x2014;he consistently acted with a righteous personal and political independence that has all but disappeared from the public sphere. <i>Political Hell-Raiser</i> is the first book to tell the full story of Wheeler, a genuine maverick whose successes and failures were woven into the political fabric of twentieth-century America.<br><br> Wheeler came of political age amid antiwar and labor unrest in Butte, Montana, during World War I. As a crusading United States attorney, he battled Montana&#x2019;s powerful economic interests, championed farmers and miners, and won election to the U.S. Senate in 1922. There he made his name as one of the &#x201c;Montana scandalmongers,&#x201d; uncovering corruption in the Harding and Coolidge administrations. Drawing on extensive research and new archival sources, Marc C. Johnson follows Wheeler from his early backing of Franklin D. Roosevelt and ardent support of the New Deal to his forceful opposition to Roosevelt&#x2019;s plan to expand the Supreme Court and, in a move widely viewed as political suicide, his emergence as the most prominent spokesman against U.S. involvement in World War II right up to three days before Pearl Harbor.<br><br> Johnson provides the most thorough telling of Wheeler&#x2019;s entire career, including all its accomplishments and contradictions, as well as the political storms that the senator both encouraged and endured. The book convincingly establishes the place and importance of this principled hell-raiser in American political history.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Marc C.

These are the novels we read, remember, and return to again and again: Margaret Atwood's <i>The Handmaid's Tale,</i> Doris Lessing's <i>The Golden Notebook,</i> and now, from Jean Hegland, an extraordinary fiction debut...<b>Into the Forest</b><i>.</i><br><br>Eva, eighteen, and Nell, seventeen, are sisters, adolescents on the threshold of womanhood&#x2014;and for them anything should be possible. But even as Eva prepares for an audition with the San Francisco Ballet and Nell dreams of her first semester at Harvard, their lives are turned upside down and their dreams are pushed into the shadows. In a nation suddenly without electricity or communications, Eva is compelled to dance alone to the music of memory, and Nell's education consists of reading the encyclopedia, devouring knowledge as if it were her last meal. Theirs is an age of darkness and terror....<br>A distant war rages overseas. Resources society had depended on, such as gas and electricity, are no longer available. Riots spread through the inner cities, while deadly viral infections spread across the countryside. Isolated in their home in the northern California woods, Eva and Nell live in a world without television or phones, in a time of suspicion and superstition, of anger, hunger, and fear. Perhaps one day the lights&#x2014;and their dreams&#x2014;will return, but orphaned by their parents' deaths and by society, Eva and Nell have been left to forage through the forest, and through their past, for the keys to survival. As they blaze a path into the forest and into the future, they become pioneers and pilgrims--not only creatures of the new world, but the creators of it.<br><br><b>Into the Forest</b> is the gripping, unforgettable story of these remarkable sisters as they struggle to redefine themselves and their life together. It is a passionate and poignant tale of stirring sensuality, chilling insight, and profound inspiration&#x2014;a novel that will move you and surprise you and touch you to the core.</p><p>Jean Hegland's prose in <i>Into the Forest</i> is as breathtaking as one of the musty, ancient redwoods that share the woodland with Nell and Eva, two sisters who must learn to live in harmony with the northern California forest when the electricity shuts off, the phones go out, their parents die, and all civilization beyond them seems to grind to a halt. At first, the girls rely on stores of food left in their parents' pantry, but when those supplies begin to dwindle, their only option is to turn to each other and the forest's plants and animals for friendship, courage, and sustenance. <i>Into the Forest</i>, an apocalyptic coming-of-age story, will fill readers (both teens and adults) with a profound sense of the human spirit's strength and beauty.Praise for Jean Hegland's <i>Into the Forest</i><br> <br> "[A] beautifully written and often profoundly moving novel."<br> <i>--San Francisco Chronicle</i><br> <br> "A work of extraordinary power, insight and lyricism, <i>Into the Forest</i> is both an urgent warning and a passionate celebration of life and love."<br> --Riane Eisler, author of <i>The Chalice and the Blade</i><br> <br> <b>*</b>"From the first page, the sense of crisis and the lucid, honest voice of the...narrator pull the reader in....A truly admirable addition to a genre defined by the very high standards of George Orwell's <i>1984.</i>"<br> <i>--Publishers Weekly,</i>starred review<br> <br> "Beautifully written."<br> <i>--Kirkus Reviews</i><br> <br> "This beautifully written story captures the essential nature of the sister bond: the fierce struggle to be true to one's own self, only to learn that true strength comes from what they are able to share together."<br> --Carol Saline, co-author of <i>Sisters</i><br> <br> "Jean Hegland's sense of character is firm, warm, and wise....[A] fine first novel."<br> --John Keeble, author of <i>Yellowfish</i> END</p><h2>Casanova&#39;s Chinese Restaurant</h2><p><i>______________________________</i><br><b>'He is, as Proust was before him, the great literary chronicler of his culture in his time.'</b> <i>GUARDIAN</i><br><br><i>A Dance to the Music of Time </i>is universally acknowledged as one of the great works of English literature.

Bound in publisher&#39;s original cloth.</p><p>As a schoolboy in Birmingham, England, Burne-Jones was already signing his name "Edouard de Bymyngham"--an early romantic impulse borne out by the life and work of this second-generation Pre-Raphaelite and leader of the aesthetic movement, whose massive output of watercolor and oil paintings, intricate pencil drawings, tapestries, stained-glass windows and other decorative objects are gathered this summer at a Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibit in New York City. In this richly illustrated monograph, Wood, a Victorianist and London gallery owner, provides a sometimes cursory but fervent portrait of the artist, whose often murky technique and sentimental narrative proclivities (Arthurian legend and fairy tales figure hugely) have had a checkered critical history. Although he was the first artist to be given a memorial service at Westminster Abbey, Burne-Jones's reputation eroded during the "darkest days of modernism," writes Wood. But Wood's enthusiasm, bolstered by the thoughtful testimony of Burne-Jones champion Henry James and the liberally quoted words of the artist himself, who is revealed as appealingly self-conscious and extremely adroit with language, is infectious. Wood perhaps overidealizes the lifelong friendship and collaboration with William Morris, begun at Oxford, but his retelling is moving all the same when, upon Morris's death in 1896, Burne-Jones writes that "the things that in thought are most of me, most dear and necessary, are dear and necessary to no one except Morris only." There are 80 full-color and 120 b&amp;w images, though the lack of comparative illustrations (especially by Burne-Jones's mentor Dante Gabriel Rossetti) impedes Wood's art-historical analysis considerably.

It offers more biographical detail, more illustrations and accessible, often illuminating, catalogue entries, with essays by Alan Crawford, Stephen Wildman and other critics and curators.

Roemer traces the life of nasty, brutish, and short Tony ``The Ant'' Spilotro, who rose from humble beginnings on the west side of Chicago to rule the West (including Las Vegas) for the Chicago crime syndicate in the 1970s and early '80s. He describes Spilotro's apprenticeship with loan shark ``Mad Sam'' DeStefano (a man Roemer questionably dubs ``the worst torture-murderer in history''); his years as hit man and ``whiz-kid'' under Felix ``Milwaukee Phil'' Alderisio, boss of the Chicago mob; and his promotion in 1971 to ``representato'' in Las Vegas, a post that included overseeing the skimming operations at top casinos and running the ``Hole-in-the-Wall Gang,'' which preyed on hotel patrons, stores, and homes. Finally, in 1986, just as he faced yet another retrial for burglary and racketeering, Spilotro was gunned down by order of the new boss, Joe Ferriola. Roemer's book has its fascinations, including a ``primer on how to skim'' and lessons on how to insult mobsters (try ``slime'' and ``scum,'' he suggests; ``eleven- and twelve-letter names [don't] seem to faze them''). But the author professes an Ahab-like obsession with his subject that doesn't quite hold up: After all, Roemer was assigned to shadow a different mobster, and his own encounters with Spilotro were limited to infrequent exchanges of name-calling. As a result, Spilotro's character, such as it was, remains a cipher. Less forgivably, the author's prose sounds as if it were ad-libbed into a dictating machine (``So it was that Tony fled from Chicago. Fled is the wrong word''), and the dialogue, which he freely admits he has ``reconstructed,'' often rings false. Best for addicts of the genre. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Retired FBI agent Roemer (Roemer, Man Against the Mob, Donald I. Fine, 1989) uses his insider's fund of information and experience to tell the story of the diminutive Tony "The Ant" Spilotro, a Chicago hit man who became the controller of mob activities in Las Vegas before he was rubbed out. Spilotro's rise up the Mafia ladder, facilitated by his natural love of violence, is the main theme of the book, but it is embedded in a web of anecdotes about contemporary mob figures, such as "Mad Sam" Destatano, whose love of torture is graphically described; Frank Cullotta, Tony's top man in the Hole in the Wall Gang; Joey Aiuppe, boss of the Chicago Outfit; and a counterbalancing roster of shining cops and FBI agents. Roemer has an easygoing, informal style, sometimes self-congratulatory, sometimes self-denigrating. He seldom gets beneath the surface of the personalities he describes, but the barroom-like chatter will be diverting for those not already sated with mob stories.

S. Eliot's lofty standing among 20th-century poets is directly attributable to his vast knowledge and deep appreciation of his literary predecessors. The importance of Eliot's role as an erudite critic of literary and cultural matters cannot be overstated. With the l920 publication of <i>The Sacred Wood</i> his reputation as a critical force was established. In his first collection of essays, Eliot defines the critic's role as one "to see literature steadily and to see it whole ... not as consecrated by time, but to see the best work of our time and the best work of twenty-five hundred years ago with the same eyes."<br>Eliot turns his penetrating gaze on such authors as Swinburne, Blake, Dante, and Ben Jonson in this collection of provocative essays. He also considers "Hamlet and His Problems," "The Possibility of Poetic Drama," and most significantly, "Tradition and the Individual Talent."<br>In addition to all of the essays in The Sacred Wood, this volume includes four features that originally appeared in <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>: "Homage to John Dryden," "Poets on Poetry," "The Metaphysical Poets," and "Andrew Marvell." Taken together, these pieces offer remarkable insights into Eliot's ideas on poetry and poets, the nature and role of literature and drama, and the function of criticism.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>It Came from Outer Space</h2><p>Gauntlet Press is thrilled to announce our upcoming publication of Ray Bradbury's four screen treatments for IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE. <p>Released in 1953, It Came From Outer Space was one of the first 3-D films made.

Homer was the first Greek writer whose work survives.</p> <p>He was one of a long line of bards, or poets, who worked in the oral tradition. Homer and other bards of the time could recite, or chant, long epic poems. Both works attributed to Homer &#x2013; the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> &#x2013; are over ten thousand lines long in the original. Homer must have had an amazing memory but was helped by the formulaic poetry style of the time.</p> <p>In the Iliad Homer sang of death and glory, of a few days in the struggle between the Greeks and the Trojans. Mortal men played out their fate under the gaze of the gods. The <i>Odyssey</i> is the original collection of tall traveller&#x2019;s tales. Odysseus, on his way home from the Trojan War, encounters all kinds of marvels from one-eyed giants to witches and beautiful temptresses. His adventures are many and memorable before he gets back to Ithaca and his faithful wife Penelope.</p> <p>We can never be certain that both these stories belonged to Homer. In fact &#x2018;Homer&#x2019; may not be a real name but a kind of nickname meaning perhaps &#x2018;the hostage&#x2019; or &#x2018;the blind one&#x2019;.

Gallagher</b><br><br>In 1864 Abraham Lincoln had privately predicted his defeat in the impending election, but ten days later Atlanta fell, assuring his victory. General Jacob D. Cox (1828-1900) played a key role in the Union success at Atlanta, a city of profound strategic and political significance. At Kenesaw Mountain in June, his division seized a ridge opposite the Confederate left, allowing Sherman to flank the Confederates out of their prepared position; in late August Cox's men served the city's final rail line, forcing Hood's evacuation. It was Cox's self-professed qualities of "a bold heart, a cool hand, and practical common-sense" that later earned him the command of the entire Twenty-third Corps and the rank of major general. <br><br>After the war, Cox applies those same attributes to his books, <i>Sherman's Battle for Atlanta</i> and <i>Sherman's March to the Sea, </i>two volumes in the landmark series Campaigns of the Civil War. In <i>Atlanta</i> Cox offers readers a compact, comprehensive, and balanced history of that campaign. William T. Sherman emerges as the primary hero of events, but he does not remain unscathed by Cox's evaluation. Cox's insightful chronicle of the campaign-from the performances of Generals Johnston's evasive maneuvers through Hood's three desperate attempts to dispel the Yankees to Sherman's triumphant telegram to Washington that "Atlanta is ours, and fairly won"-has endured the scrutiny of time.<br><i>Introduction by Brooks D.

Immediately forces began to assemble in opposition to the Bolshevik regime, and these became known as the Whites.

The security services are not all-powerful; they have made clumsy and sometimes catastrophic blunders. But what is clear is that after the chaotic 1990s, when they were sidelined, they have made a remarkable return to power, abetted by their most famous alumnus, Putin.</p></p><p><b>Andrei Soldatov</b> and <b>Irina Borogan</b> are co-founders of the Agentura.Ru website.

He draws from a multitude of primary sources, including personal correspondence and political memoranda, to show how Britain, at the height of her power but suffering from internal political strife, made one mistake after another, culminating in the loss of her prized colonies. In opposition to King George&#39;s American policies were such towering figures as William Pitt, Edmund Burke, and Charles James Fox; their speeches in the House of Commons are some of the best oratory in the English language. But despite their eloquence and forcefulness, they did not have the votes to prevail. In the end, the Americans rebelled as much against an English political state of mind as against the British Army. Cook takes us through the war years: King George&#39;s decision that &#34;blows must decide&#34; the colonies&#39; future; Lord North&#39;s futile effort to negotiate peace after the British defeat at Saratoga, which only hastened the American alliance with France; the secret letter from Washington to Lafayette that the British intercepted, perhaps altering the outcome of the Battle of Yorktown; and the peace negotiations masterminded by Franklin and John Jay.Retelling the saga of the American Revolution from the viewpoint of Mother England, Cook ingeniously portrays the 13 colonies' breakaway as a succession of inexorable blunders and collective missteps in London that led to an unnecessary, unwinnable war. Former political correspondent for the Los Angeles Times and the New York Herald Tribune, Cook lays the lion's share of blame at the feet of autocratic King George III, who prodded his government into war-provoking acts, refusing all suggestions of compromise. Cook's vivid, wonderfully readable narrative sheds new light on the origins of the American Revolution and is peopled with memorable characters: Anglophile diplomat/scientist Benjamin Franklin, testifying before the House of Commons in London against the oppressive Stamp Act in 1766; Isaac Barre, fierce, rough-talking, one-eyed British colonel, sympathetic to the American cause, who warned Parliament that a revolution could be brewing; amiable, indecisive British prime minister Lord North, totally unfit to wage war, who repeatedly tendered his resignation in vain; parliamentarian William Pitt, who dared to question the king's wisdom in fiery oratory. Cook provocatively concludes that with a more conciliatory policy, England might well have reached an accommodation that would have kept the American colonies in the British Empire. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>On the Beach</h2><p>On the Beach is about a subject that many writers would be too afraid to discuss. It tells of the terrible effects of a worldwide nuclear war. In 1957, when the book first appeared, many people were afraid of nuclear arms and radiation. The first nuclear bomb was tested in New Mexico in July 1945. In August 1945 nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, killing 70,000 people immediately. Many more died later from burns and radioactive poisoning. From 1946 until 1958 the United States tested nuclear bombs on Bikini Atoll. Those who had been living on the island were allowed to return there in 1969, but had to leave again in 1978 after the lasting effects of radiation became clearer. This story takes place in Melbourne, Australia. There has been a terrible nuclear war in northern countries. All life has been destroyed there by radiation. In Melbourne some people are still alive. Peter and Mary Holmes and their baby daughter Jennifer are trying to live their lives as normally as possible. The story tells how life changes for this family, and for their friends and neighbours, as the deadly radiation slowly moves south towards them.</p><p>8 1-hour cassettes"The most shocking fiction I have read in years.

Withdrawn in manner, conventional in dress, and virtually unknown for the first half of his career, the French painter and graphic artist drew upon his own startlingly complex and fantastic inner world to create haunting works that reveal an existence beyond that of everyday vision. He transformed common subjects and models into strange, eerie images and exhibited a predilection for spiders and serpents, skeletons and skulls, gnomes and monsters--all rendered in a distinctive style of controlled, delicate realism.<br>Redon's popularity arose chiefly among young progressive artists, who considered his works as visual correspondence to the literary symbolism of Mallarm�.

Now he turns his attention to an even more controversial subject. A Nation of Victims is the first book on the startling decay of the American backbone and the disease that is causing it.<br>The spread of victimism has been widely noted in the media; indeed, its symptoms have produced best-selling books, fueled television ratings, spawned hundreds of support groups, and enriched tens of thousands of lawyers across the country. The plaint of the victim - Its not my fault - has become the loudest and most influential voice in America, an instrument of personal and lasting political change.<br>In this incisive, pugnacious, frequently hilarious book, Charles Sykes reveals a society that is tribalizing, where individuals and groups define themselves not by shared culture, but by their status as victims. Victims of parents, of families, of men, of women, of the workplace, of sex, of stress, of drugs, of food, of college reading lists, of personal physical characteristics - these and a host of other groups are engaged in an ever-escalating fight for attention, sympathy, money, and legal or governmental protection.<br>What's going on and how did we get to this point? Sykes traces the inexorable rise of the therapeutic culture and the decline of American self-reliance. With example after example, he shows how victimism has co-opted the genuine victories of the civil-rights movement for less worthy goals. And he offers hope: the prospect of a culture of renewed character, where society lends compassion to those who truly need it.<br>Like Shelby Steele, Charles Murray, and Dinesh D'Souza, Charles Sykes defines the ground of what will be a significant national debate.</p><p>This book has its origins in my previous explorations into higher education, especially my encounter with those odd permutation of political correctness that can be found on so many American university campuses.<p><b>Charles J.

Now, the psychic bond Nika forged with her sibling on that terrible night is fading, and time is running out. But the one man who can unlock the power inside her may be the greatest danger to her.</p><p>After spending too many years as an industrial engineer, Shannon learned to write from her husband, bestselling author Jim Butcher. She learned writing craft in order to help him with his stories, but found the idea of writing her own too compelling to resist. She lives in Missouri with her husband and son, where conversations at the dinner table are more often about things someone made up than about anything that&#x2019;s actually happened. Feel free to contact Shannon via her website.Nika Madison will go to any lengths to prove that her sister Tori is not dead, but rather a prisoner of the monstrous Synestryn. When Nika escapes the Sentinels&#x2019; stronghold to dig up the bones purported to be Tori&#x2019;s remains, she is attacked by ravening sgath. Madoc, a Theronai warrior who is close to losing his soul, saves her. Nika is horribly pained by the touch of Theronai men who hope the blood in her veins is their redemption, but she finds Madoc&#x2019;s touch enjoyable. When Tori, pregnant by an evil monster, realizes her captor is using her to lure Nika, she tries to sever their psychic link. But Nika is determined to save her sister before she gives birth, and finds new strength through a bond with Madoc that thrusts them and the other Sentinels into a violent and bloody battle. Myriad characters, multiple subplots, complex relationships, and overwhelming love build to a kaleidoscopic climax. The fourth book in Butcher&#x2019;s Sentinels series continues to unite couples and forces of good against the demonic forces of evil. --Diana Tixier Herald</p><h2>The Egyptian</h2><p>First published in the United States in 1949 and widely condemned as obscene, The Egyptian outsold every other novel published that year, and remains a classic; readers worldwide have testified to its life-changing power. It is a full-bodied re-creation of a largely forgotten era in the world&#39;s history: the Egypt of the 14th century B.C.E., when pharaohs and gods contended with the near-collapse of history&#39;s greatest empire. This epic tale encompasses the whole of the then-known world, from Babylon to Crete, from Thebes to Jerusalem, while centering around one unforgettable figure: Sinuhe, a man of mysterious origins who rises from the depths of degradation to become personal physician to Pharaoh Akhnaton.</p><p></p><h2>Erasmus, the Anabaptists, and the Great Commission</h2><p>Many scholars have pointed to the influence of Erasmus on the early Swiss Anabaptists and Menno Simons. Yet the truth of this contention has never been firmly established. This volume uses new research data and argumentation to build a more convincing case for the early Anabaptist movement&#39;s dependence on Erasmus&#39;s thought.Abraham Friesen first surveys the various ways Anabaptist history has been interpreted. He then discusses the state of scholarship regarding the relationship of Erasmus to the Anabaptists and suggests a new approach to the question. In the main body of the text, Friesen traces the intellectual origins of both Swiss Anabaptism and Menno Simons to the writings of Erasmus -- especially to Erasmus&#39;s unique interpretation of Christ&#39;s Great Commission as presented in his famous paraphrases of Matthew and Acts -- and shows the impact that this interpretation ultimately had on the form and content of Anabaptist thought.</p><p></p><h2>John Burnet of Barns</h2><p>John Burnet of Barns&nbsp;was Buchan's first fully realised, full-length work of fiction. It tells the story of two young noblemen - John Burnet, heir to the ancient house of Barns the last in a long line of Border reivers, and his cousin, Captain Gilbert Burnet, a dashing, ruthless soldier.<br><br>Their lifelong rivalry results in treachery, betrayal and a desperate struggle for survival.</p><p>John Buchan was a Scottish diplomat, barrister, journalist, historian, poet and novelist. He published nearly 30 novels and seven collections of short stories. He was born in Perth, an eldest son, and studied at Glasgow and Oxford. After spells as a war correspondent, Lloyd George&#39;s Director of Information and Conservative MP, Buchan moved to Canada in 1935. He served as Governor General there until his death in 1940.Buchan knew that you can't buck the consequences of your actions, and that your life is what you make of it.

Bad puns and illustrated facts abound, with the text ranging from discussions of laws including the Ten Commandments, laws of ancient Kings such as Sennacherib and Ashurbanipal of Assyria, Hammurabi's code, and Roman and Greek law. The section on Rotten Rulers includes information on the Shang dynasty in China, Roman Emperor Claudius, Attila the Hun, Countess Elizabeth Bathory of Transylvania, and Josef Stalin, among others. Several pages are dedicated to ancient Rome, with another section on Beastly Barbarians. A spread is devoted to the rules of war over the ages. Human sacrifices are covered in all their gory detail. Slavery, as well as the poor working conditions of the lower classes during the Industrial Revolution, is examined. Wars and massacres make up the last chapter, with an illustrated fold-out section at the end of Vicious Villains. There is a European slant to the coverage, but the ancient Middle East, Egypt, Asia, and the Americas are touched upon. While the scope is necessarily cursory given the limited number of pages, and therefore not useful for reports, readers are likely to be fascinated, and there is enough here to whet their appetite for more research. A great choice for reluctant readers.<i>&#x2013;Nancy Silverrod, San Francisco Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The views are supported basically from Scripture, with corroborative support from John Wesley and the Holiness Movement--and from the entire remembered past of the Church. It prefers John Wesley (a father of the church birthed later on) to the Holiness Movement on many issues, as on the witness of the Spirit. It prefers the Holiness Movement to Mr. Wesley on two important matters: entire sanctification as instantaneous only and not also gradual (although sanctification as such is gradual); and on entire sanctification&#x2019;s being effected by Christ&#x2019;s baptism with the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The Wesleyan-Holiness tradition has had a more distinguished theological tradition than is usually recognized. A reputable series of excellent systematic theological works was produce by this tradition throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th century.J.

He is capable of love, but he knows time is running out. His mother was brutally murdered, and he never knew his father. With each passing day he perceives his anger with an almost religious sense of beauty. In an attempt to save himself, he decides to marry a mail-order bride from Russia. <br><br>Russell Boyd is a state trooper who resists those acts that damage life forever. He has seen about as much of them as he can take. And yet, he has met the woman who makes him feel whole. She is the center of his life. <br><br>Frank Kohler&#x2019;s and Russell Boyd&#x2019;s paths will cross three times. And the third time will change everything. It is the moment when the line between good and evil is made dramatically clear. <br><br>As with such modern classics as Dennis Lehane&#x2019;s<b> Mystic River</b> and Graham Greene&#x2019;s <b>The Heart of the Matter</b>, Craig Nova gives us an illuminating story of characters who struggle against the collisions of fate, and who are motivated by the touching need to be human.</p><p>"Nova executes like a chess master, all the while ratcheting up the tension and calling into question any sense of security, order, or reason. Like the best of noir, Nova's unsettling novels, serpentine in their structure, speed, and toxic bite, remind us that while dark forces are always present, we must embrace love."<br><b>-<i>Booklist<br></i><br></b>"CRUISERS<i> </i>just made me hold my breath. It's so intense, it blew me away. Sentence by sentence, the book is just fabulous."<br><b>-Ann Beattie<br><br></b>"Thrilling, intense, as arresting as blue lights flashing in the rear view mirror, Craig Nova's CRUISERS takes the reader on a high speed chase through a psychological landscape that is by turns menacing, violent, and inexplicably tender. This is a powerful novel, comparable to Graham Greene in the complexity of its moral vision, yet Nova's prose is thoroughly American, as straightforward and seductive as the fate that steadily draws his characters into firing range of each other. Craig Nova is a great writer and this is his best book yet. I couldn't put it down."<br><b>-Valerie Martin, author of <i>Property</i> and <i>Mary Reilly<br><br></i></b>"Craig Nova's new novel, <i>Cruisers,</i> is a beautifully written exploration of terrorism and subverted love. Frank Kohler is the most frightening literary madman since Hannibal Lecter, and Russell Boyd is the most real and engaging police officer in recent fiction. With <i>Cruisers,</i> acclaimed novelist Craig Nova has taken us into the very heart of the senseless violence besetting our times, and miraculously, out the other side again into hope and redemption." <br><b>-Howard Frank Mosher, author of <i>Waiting for Teddy Williams<br></i></b><br>"Few novelists plumb as deeply as Craig Nova what it means to be human: Our flaws, our joys, and the way every day offers a mixture of hope and dread. <i>Cruisers</i>, like Nova's other work, is rich with the small, beautifully imagined details that make up a life. It is also, however, an absolutely riveting, page-turning drama. You will never look at a state trooper quite the same way again after reading this extraordinary book."<br><b>-Chris Bohjalian, bestselling author of <i>Midwives</i> and <i>The Buffalo Soldier</i><br></b>As a child Frank Kohler learned of his mother&#39;s brutal murder. Now, years later, he yearns for some affirmation that remains elusive. As a state trooper on the night shift, Russell Boyd cruises the highways of Vermont constantly reminded of the true depths of human misery. The lives of these two men will intersect only tangentially, until fate catches up with them.</p><h2>Jem (And Sam)</h2><p>In an evocative novel of Restoration London, Jeremiah Mount, a dealer in pornography, describes his love affair with the Duchess of Albemarle and his relationship with Samuel Pepys, a one-time friend and drinking partner who became a fierce rival for fame and women. by the author of Umbrella.</p><p>Perhaps the only urge stronger than to write a diary of one's own is the compulsion to read someone else's. Ana�s Nin's fiction is nowhere near as widely read as the many volumes of her journals, while Anne Frank's <i>Diary of a Young Girl</i> is required reading in schools around the world. And Samuel Pepys, the 17th-century British civil servant, would most likely have sunk into complete obscurity if not for the lively reckoning he kept of the times he lived in, the people he knew, and what he thought about it all. Because of his diary, Pepys's life is an open book; but what of the myriad personalities he mentions in passing? In <i>Jem (and Sam)</i>, Ferdinand Mount uses his putative ancestor Jeremiah Mount, a real-life drinking companion of the great diarist, as a springboard into the tumultuous 1600s.<p> The premise of Mount's novel is that "Jem" Mount was more than just a drinking buddy of Pepys's; indeed, he was something of a rival--albeit an unsuccessful one--in love, in politics, and ultimately in literature. The fictional diary begins with its narrator's childhood in Kent, and follows his progress: at 17 he's apprenticed to his uncle in Dover, and by 21 he's joined the civil service in Oliver Cromwell's new republic. Needless to say, Jem (who has already learned the fine art of cooking the books while working for his uncle) finds London a far more lucrative place to apply his skills, and at first he does well. It is during these heady, early days that Jem meets Sam Pepys, "a little man with eyes like children's marbles knocking together and a nose like a quill which he dipped into mine host's ink with a quick sucking motion as though he wished to empty the tavern before he was emptied out of it. He was all motion like a turbulent sea, yet neat." The two become friends, but when Cromwell dies and the monarchy is restored, Jem jumps from government employ into the service of a war hero whom he is secretly cuckolding, while Pepys stays in the civil service. It isn't long before Jem realizes his mistake, as he is gradually transformed into a glorified nanny, major domo, and occasional paramour while his friend rises spectacularly through the government ranks. Soon Jem is coveting everything Pepys has and doing his best (which of course, isn't enough) to get it all for himself.</p><p> Ferdinand Mount has crafted this picaresque tale with wit, intelligence, and a thorough knowledge of the times and the vocabulary with which to describe it. History real and imagined are seamlessly interwoven in a style Pepys himself would have been glad to own. By the end you'll find it difficult to believe the real Jeremiah Mount <i>didn't</i> write this diary; at the same time, you'll probably never look at Samuel Pepys's own effort in quite the same way again. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Ferdinand Mount is the editor of the Times Literary Supplement and a Sunday Times columnist.</p><h2>Granuaile: The Life and Times of Grace O&#39;Malley 1503-1603</h2><p>Using state papers and manuscripts of the period, Anne Chambers reveals the woman behind the legend and presents one of history&#39;s most remarkable women against the turbulent political environment of her time. What emerges is a woman who challenges our predisposed sense of convention, who, over four hundred years ago, was one of the first women to break the mold and make a unique contribution to history.</p><p>Anne Chambers is a novelist, scriptwriter, and bestselling biographer. Her books include As Wicked a Woman, Eleanor Countess of Desmond (shortlisted for the 1987 GPA Award), Adorable Diva, the biography of the prima donna, Margaret Burke Sheridan, and The Geraldine Conspiracy, a historical novel.</p><h2>A Thousand and One Formulas</h2><p>This book, &#34;A thousand and one formulas; the laboratory handbook for the experimenter&#34;, by Gernsback, Sidney, 1876-, is a replication of a book originally published before 1920. It has been restored by human beings, page by page, so that you may enjoy it in a form as close to the original as possible. This book was created using print-on-demand technology.

This book preserves a record of the log houses, stores, inns, churches, schools, jails, and barns that have already become all too few in the Texas countryside. Terry Jordan explores the use of log buildings among several different Texas cultural groups and traces their construction techniques from their European and eastern American origins.</p></p><p>The late Terry G. Jordan held the Walter Prescott Webb Chair in History and Ideas in the geography department at the University of Texas at Austin."So well written that it will appeal not only to folklorists and architectural historians but also to anyone who has ever stopped the car on a Sunday afternoon and walked across a pasture to look at an old house." (<i>Dallas Morning News</i>)<br><br>"What is undoubtedly one of the most important books in recent years on Old West architecture . . . will cause many a reader to dream of owning his or her own log cabin far from the bustle of civilization." (<i>Frontier Times</i>)<br><br>". . . will bring a new awareness of a vanishing type of architecture and a fresh appreciation of the surviving log structures." (<i>Houston Post</i>)</p><h2>Striving Toward Wholeness</h2><p>&#34;In earlier days it was self-evident that every living creature was striving to complete the pattern of its existence as fully as possible. In out rational times, however, with their ever-increasing demand for specialization this fact seems to be almost forgotten, although in the unconscious the urge toward wholeness appears to have become stronger for having been repressed and forgotten.&#34; In this study o individuation in literature, Barbara Hannah concentrates on the biographies and work of five major English novelists - Robert Louis Stevenson, Mary Webb, Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bronte - and one failed artist - Branwell Bronte - examining how their works attempt to integrate both negative and positive elements of the individual psyche, thus allowing for a metaphoric &#34;return to Eden.&#34; Hannah gives us a fruitful interpretation of &#34;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,&#34; as well as an extensive reading of Wurthering Heights in the context of both literary and psychological traditions. Barbara Hannah is the author of the classic work on individuation through creative fantasy, Encounters with the Soul: Active Imagination as Developed by C. G. Jung. According to Hannah, literature itself can be seen as a very complex form of active imagination, certainly for the author or artist, but also for the reader or viewer of a piece of art. Not only does Hannah&#39;s book provide fresh and innovative ways of looking at all artistic creation, but on the individual plane it is clearly an insightful guide as to how we can all become more conscious of our unconscious goal of &#34;striving towards wholeness.&#34; Like Encounters with the Soul, Striving Towards Wholeness embodies the thoughtful and compassionate approach to individual psychic needs that characterized the late Barbara Hannah both in and out of her analytic practice. --- from book&#39;s back cover</p><p></p><h2>How to Draw</h2><p>An instructional handbook on the art of drawing, this book provides chapters on perspective, viewpoint, composition, shadows and reflections together with advice on drawing people, animals and trees, using a sketchbook, copying from photographs, etc. Adrian Hill has been President of ROI, member of RBA and RI, Vice-President of British Association of Art Therapists and the St James&#39; Art Society.</p><p></p><h2>The Off Grid Guide to Field Medicine</h2><p><b>Off Grid Medical Book Description</b> This off grid guide to field medicine is designed to help the reader with diagnosing certain conditions while out in the wilderness. This guide also furnishes the reader with important information regarding the actions to be taken when in an active environment, such as a mass shooting event, a bomb detonation, etc. The information in this guide is designed to help uninjured caregivers with providing medical assistance for a wide variety of serious, and even potentially life threatening situations. This guide is not intended to help cover minor injuries and illnesses, but rather focuses on mending broken arms, legs, and bones, as well as stopping massive blood loss, which remains one of the leading causes of death when injuries occur in places where conventional medical care is unavailable. Caregivers will also discover what actions to take while in an active environment, and how to evacuate the injured to a safer location to perform more intensive life saving measures. They will also learn how to identify and treat shock and how to position patients and monitor them after treatment has been administered. Finally, this guide will discuss several methods of controlling blood loss from massive injuries, and how to treat them while in the field. Readers will also learn how to manage a patient&#x2019;s airway to maintain proper airflow and make it easier for the patient to breathe on their own. Caregivers will also discover how to properly manage penetrating chest wounds, which can be among the worst to contend with in an active environment, or in the wilderness.</p><p></p><h2>Feasting on the Word Worship Companion: Liturgies for Year B, Volume 2</h2><p><p>This is the sixth and final volume in the Feasting on the Word Worship Companion series, which provides liturgical pieces used in preparing for worship.

In that time hundreds of thousands of fans have ravenously devoured the adventures of Armstrong's witches, demons, and werewolves. Now, in <i>Spell Bound</i>, she brings them all together for her most sweeping tale yet. <br><br> Savannah Levine is in terrible danger, and for once she's powerless to help herself. At the heartbreaking conclusion of <i>Waking the Witch</i>, Savannah swore that she would give up her powers if it would prevent further pain for a young orphan. Little did she know that someone would take her up on that promise. <br><br> And now, witch-hunting assassins, necromancers, half-demons, and rogue witches all seem to be after her. The threat is not just for Savannah; every member of the Otherworld might be at risk. While most of her fellow supernaturals are circling the wagons at a gathering of the council in Miami, Savannah is caught on the road, isolated from those who can protect her and unable to use her vast spell-casting talent, the thing she counts on most. In a story that will change the shape of the Otherworld forever, Armstrong gathers Elena, Clay, Paige, Lucas, Jamie, Hope, and other beloved characters, who soon learn that the greatest threat to supernaturals just may come from within.</p><p>Kelley Armstrong lives in rural southwestern Canada with her husband and three children.<p> </p><p> </p>Sitting g cross-legged on my motel bed in the dark, I cast my light-ball spell for the twentieth time. As I recited the incantation, I waited for the mental click that told me it had worked. When that didn&#x2019;t come, I opened my eyes, still expecting to see the glowing ball floating over my fingers. It didn&#x2019;t matter that I hadn&#x2019;t seen it the first nineteen times. It was a damned light-ball spell, so simple I usually didn&#x2019;t even need to finish the incantation before it worked.<br>&nbsp;<br>The room stayed dark.<br>&nbsp;<br>On a chair by the bed, Adam mumbled and shifted in his sleep. Adam Vasic, Exustio half-demon, the guy I&#x2019;d been in love with since I was twelve, now my best friend. He&#x2019;d followed me when I took off in a tantrum of guilt and grief, snuck into my motel room, and quietly fell asleep.<br>&nbsp;<br>He was close to waking now, and even my whispered incantations had him fussing. He needed sleep, not more of my angst, so I slid from the room.<br>&nbsp;<br>I stepped outside. It was a wet spring night, the earlier storm gone, whipping winds and a bone-chilling cold left behind. I walked over to Adam&#x2019;s Jeep, parked beside my vintage Triumph motorcycle. I peered through the back of his vehicle, in case I&#x2019;d left a sweater there. All I could see was his duffel bag, and I didn&#x2019;t want to break in and go through his stuff, which was proof that I really wasn&#x2019;t myself tonight.<br>&nbsp;<br>A soda machine glowed across the motel lot. I wasn&#x2019;t thirsty, but I had change in my pocket and it gave me a destination. After sloshing through one puddle in the dark, I didn&#x2019;t bother trying to avoid the rest, just trudged along, icy water soaking my sneakers. When gravel crackled to my left, I spun and spotted a shape darting behind the motel. Which reminded me . . . Besides losing my powers, I was also the target of a witch-hunter. Apparently she&#x2019;d found me again.<br>&nbsp;<br>I glanced toward my room. I should get Adam. Without my spells, I was&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;<br>Powerless? Hardly. I was six feet tall and in great shape. The witch-hunter was a scrawny mouse of a girl, barely an adult, barely five-foot-five, with no apparent supernatural powers. I took another step, careful now, and instinctively started whispering a sensing spell under my breath. Then I stopped. Do it the old-fashioned way. Look and listen.<br>&nbsp;<br>I did, but couldn&#x2019;t hear anything. Peering around the corner didn&#x2019;t help. Then gravel crunched overhead.<br>&nbsp;<br>On the roof. A trick she&#x2019;d pulled before. I should have been prepared.<br>&nbsp;<br>I looked around. There had to be a fire escape or trash bins I could climb&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;<br>A loud noise sent me spinning, back to the wall, hands lifted for a spell. Tires squealed as a car roared past the motel.<br>&nbsp;<br>I looked down at my fingers, still outstretched, ready to cast. I inhaled sharply and clenched my fists.<br>&nbsp;<br>What if she did have a gun? Sure, I knew some martial arts, but I was no black belt. I&#x2019;d learned grudgingly, knowing my spells were better than any roundhouse kick.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;d love to bring this kid down on my own, but the important thing was to stop her before she targeted another witch. Time to get backup.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was two doors from my room when a hand clamped on my shoulder. I spun, fingers flying up in a useless knockback spell. It was a man, a huge guy, at least three hundred pounds and a few inches taller than me. Beard stubble covered his fleshy face. He smelled like he&#x2019;d showered in Jack Daniel&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You got a dollar?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hungry.&#x201d; He pointed at the vending machine. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t got a dollar.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Neither do I,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>He grabbed my arm and yanked me, his other arm going around my waist as he pulled me against him. I froze. Just froze, my brain stuttering through all the spells I couldn&#x2019;t cast, refusing to offer any alternatives.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Let her go,&#x201d; said a familiar voice.<br>&nbsp;<br>Adam walked over, hands at his sides, fingers glowing faintly, gaze fixed on the man.

Augustine wrote of it, "Methinks Isaiah writes not a prophect, but a gospel.

Reprint.</p><p><p>A full-time writer, <b>James Sallis</b> lives with his wife in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>Originally published in 2000, this mystery introduces Sallis&#39;s private investigator, Lew Griffin. The book feels more like a short story collection than a novel as the focus is not a single mystery but many, and the various cases take place over three decades. Instead, the common thread is Griffin himself. Although he frequently finds missing persons, Griffin also struggles to find himself. Narrator G. Valmont Thomas expertly captures Griffin&#39;s hard-boiled intensity. In addition, he draws the listener into the sultry and somber atmosphere of the French Quarter of New Orleans. The combination of Thomas&#39;s voice and Sallis&#39;s words brings the listener into a dark world.

The Roxburys had reigned at Mooncoign for longer than living memory ran, and to those within their domain, it seemed they always would.Even in that bygone generation there had been no one left who could say how the house had come to be so named--or if there were, they deemed it wiser, in a climate of uncertain political and theological tolerance, to keep the knowledge to themselves. For while Charles II, that merry monarch, had often said that the witches of England should be left in peace, the temper of his son, the once-Earl of Monmouth, was a chancier--and far more Protestant--thing.But the time of both merry father and ambitious son was long past now. It was early in April, on a morning of no particular note in the calendars of alchemists and philosophers: a day much likeany other day on the Wiltshire downs for every inhabitant of the great house save one.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The room's furnishings were opulent and old; heavy walnut pieces that might have occupied this very chamber when Charles Stuart had used it to shelter from his Roundhead persecutors some one hundred fifty years before. The oak wainscoting glowed golden with long and loving application of beeswax and turpentine even in this pallid early spring sunlight, while higher upon those same walls fanciful plasterwork ornamentation spread its delicate lacelike tracery against the darker cream of the limewashed background. The room was oven hot, heated by the blazing fire of sea-coals upon the hearth and by the tall bronze braziers the doctor had prescribed.Now that same physician regarded the luxurious scene with disapproval, although it was not the elegant Jacobean room itself which had earned his censure. He turned to the waiting servant and, reluctantly, said what he must say."You ought to have called me earlier. Her Ladyship's condition is very grave. In fact--" He hesitated, choosing how best to break the hateful news."Speak louder, Dr. Falconer; I cannot quite hear you." The mocking young voice was hoarse with coughing and breathless with its owner's affliction, but it still held arresting power.Dr. Falconer straightened from his colloquy with Lady Roxbury's formidably-correct dresser and returned to the ornately-caparisoned bed of state. Pulling back the bedcurtains with one well-manicured hand, he gazed down at the bed's occupant. His patient stared back with brilliant unflinching eyes.Sarah, Marchioness of Roxbury, had never been a beauty--her eyes (quite her best feature) were grey, her hair was silk-straight rather than fashionably curled (and light brown rather than guinea-gold or raven-black or any of the other unlikely hues so beloved of the <i>romancers</i>), and she was tall and slender--but she had always carried herself with the arrogance and style of the Conynghams. Now, however, even the animal vitality that had lent her passableplainness an aura of glamour was gone: the Marchioness of Roxbury looked exactly like what she was. A plain woman, and a dying one."As bad as that, is it?" she whispered. "You had best tell me, you know; Knoyle is a treasure with hair, but she will only cry."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Marchioness's mother, the second Marchioness of Roxbury and illegitimate daughter of James the Second, the present king's grandfather, had died in childbed along with the babe who would, had he lived, have been the two-year-old Sarah's younger brother and heir to the Marchionate. Now mother and son slept in the small family burial ground at Mooncoign, and from the moment of their deaths, Sarah Marie Eloise Aradia Dowsabelle Conyngham had become Lady Roxbury, Marchioness of Roxbury in her own right. And each year, since her presentation to the Polite World at the early age of sixteen, the young Marchioness of Roxbury had anticipated the Season with a houseparty at Mooncoign. The entertainment was lavish and theatrical, and in this year of Our Lord 1805, ten days since, during an enactment of the Battle of the Nile upon Mooncoign's ornamental water, her ladyship's craft had accidentally been sunk, even though it was meant to represent Admiral Nelson's flagship, the <i>Victory</i>.She had been rescued by the Vicomte Saint-Lazarre and, though her crew had deserted to the house to repair their soaked toilettes, Lady Roxbury had remained to fight the engagement to an English triumph. She had ignored a steadily-worsening cough to mastermind the entertainment of her guests all the following week; the cost of that mock sea-battle was something she had not counted until today.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Outside the windows, pale April daffodils pushed up through the rich loam of the downs. Dr. Falconer studied Lady Roxbury for some moments before he spoke. "It is a galloping consumption, Your Ladyship. You will not see out the month."Lady Roxbury's mouth tightened and the teasing light vanishedfrom her eyes. She had suspected as much; only a fool would not, once the blood began to appear on her lawn kerchiefs.There was a strangled sob from Knoyle."Hush your howling," Lady Roxbury rasped hoarsely. "Anyone would think you were to be turned out without a character! It was only a chill," she said to Dr. Falconer, hating the note of pleading she heard in her voice."It has settled on the lungs." His voice was gentle, but her ladyship heard the death sentence in it. Dr. Falconer was no country horse-leech after all, but King Henry's own physician. His skill was preeminent; there were few he would have left Town for, but the Marchioness of Roxbury was one."I ... see," she said. Each breath was a struggle. A greater struggle was to resist the feathery unsoundness in her throat and chest that brought the wracking spasms of bloody coughing. "Thank you for coming, Doctor," Lady Roxbury said. She held out one slender jeweled hand, and Dr. Falconer bent over it with courtly punctilio."Please consider yourself my guest for as long as you care to--and assure my other guests I will be joining them soon," she said.Dr. Falconer hesitated a moment before replying. "Of course, Your Ladyship. I shall carry out your wishes to the letter." He hesitated over her hand a moment longer, as if there were something he would say, then turned and left.Lady Roxbury turned to her abigail."Knoyle." The one word was all she could manage; the tainted brittleness in her chest was rising into her throat, choking her. She reached out blindly, grabbing the abigail's broad warm hand with chill fingers of surprising strength."No one! Tell--no one!" she gasped. Then the treacherous creature in her chest woke to willful life and spasm after spasm shook her slender body, until she lay weak and trembling beneath a coverlet starred with her life's blood.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>It is not fair,</i> she thought to herself some hours later. The pop and hiss of the burning coals and the measured ticking of the long-caseclock in the dressing room were the loudest sounds in Lady Roxbury's world. She did not doubt that all was being done within Mooncoign's walls just as she would have it done, but she realized unwillingly that the time was coming when she would no longer be able to enforce her wishes--when, in fact, she would have no wishes at all.And then Mooncoign and the Marchionate, which was entailed upon the heirs of her body, male or female, would revert to the Crown, and someone not of her blood would walk Mooncoign's galleries of age-mellowed stone.<i>It is not fair!</i> Though the side-curtains of the bed were closed, Lady Roxbury had ordered the curtains at the foot drawn back so that she could see the portrait over the fire. Within its frame of gilded plaster, the painted visage of Lady Roxbury's grandmother Panthea, the first Marchioness, gazed mischievously down at her descendent, magnificent in satin and lace. Panthea's bejeweled hands toyed with a key, a dagger, and a rose, in sly allusion to the Roxbury arms and their motto: "I open every door."Oh, if there were only a door for this, away from the cruel weakness of her body and the knowledge of duties unfulfilled--!"A visitor for you, my lady." Knoyle's voice trembled--as well it might, since she was acting against her mistress's express orders to admit no one.Lady Roxbury struggled upright against her pillows, anger deepening the hectic color in her cheeks. "Who--" she began, before the inevitable spasm of coughing took her. As she clutched her handkerchief to her lips, she felt strong cool hands against her back, supporting her and pressing the worst of the pain away."Who dares?" she demanded at last, when the paroxysm passed."I dare," a voice said calmly. "As Your Ladyship knows, there is little I do not."Lady Roxbury's eyes widened fractionally as she caught sight of her visitor for the first time.Dame Alecto Kennet had been a great beauty in her day, and was still a woman of commanding and formidable presence. In her time she had been actress and confidential agent, mistress to two Kings, and more. In later life she had chosen obscurity as the companionof the Dowager Duchess of Wessex, herself a woman who shunned the limelight. Even so, only the veriest of greenheads would hold Dame Alecto at naught."I had thought you in Bath with Her Grace of Wessex," Lady Roxbury managed to say. She lay back against the mounded lace-trimmed pillows, trembling with the effort of showing an untroubled countenance to her visitor."And so I might yet be, did you not need me more," Dame Alecto replied. She unpinned her wide, plume-t...</p><h2>Majestic Hollywood: The Greatest Films of 1939</h2><p><p>1939 was a watershed year.

Though it was a cold December day, werewolves didn&#x2019;t feel weather as acutely as humans, and Jordan had his jacket off and his shirtsleeves rolled up. They were seated opposite each other on a patch of browning grass in a clearing in Central Park, both cross-legged, their hands on their knees, palms up.<br> <br>An outcropping of rock rose from the ground near them. It was broken up into larger and smaller boulders, and atop one of the larger boulders perched Alec and Isabelle Lightwood. As Jace looked up, Isabelle caught his eye and gave him an encouraging wave. Alec, noting her gesture, smacked her shoulder. Jace could see him lecturing Izzy, probably about not breaking Jace&#x2019;s concentration. He smiled to himself&#x2014;neither of them really had a reason to be here, but they had come anyway, &#x201c;for moral support.&#x201d; Though, Jace suspected it had more to do with the fact that Alec hated to be at loose ends these days, Isabelle hated for her brother to be on his own, and both of them were avoiding their parents and the Institute.<br> <br>Jordan snapped his fingers under Jace&#x2019;s nose. &#x201c;Are you paying any attention?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace frowned. &#x201c;I was, until we wandered into the territory of bad personal ads.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, what kind of thing does make you feel calm and peaceful?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace took his hands off his knees&#x2014;the lotus position was giving him wrist cramps&#x2014;and leaned back on his arms. Chilly wind rattled the few dead leaves that still clung to the branches of the trees. Against the pale winter sky the leaves had a spare elegance, like pen and ink sketches. &#x201c;Killing demons,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;A good clean kill is very relaxing. The messy ones are more annoying, because you have to clean up afterward&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Jordan held his hands up. Below the sleeves of his shirt, the tattoos that wrapped his arms were visible. Shaantih, shaantih, shaantih. Jace knew it meant &#x201c;the peace that passes understanding&#x201d; and that you were supposed to say the word three times every time you uttered the mantra, to calm your mind. But nothing seemed to calm his, these days. The fire in his veins made his mind race too, thoughts coming too quickly, one after another, like exploding fireworks. Dreams as vivid and saturated with color as oil paintings. He&#x2019;d tried training it out of himself, hours and hours spent in the practice room, blood and bruises and sweat and once, even, broken fingers. But he hadn&#x2019;t managed to do much more than irritate Alec with requests for healing runes and, on one memorable occasion, accidentally set fire to one of the crossbeams.<br> <br>It was Simon who had pointed out that his roommate meditated every day, and who&#x2019;d said that learning the habit was what had calmed the uncontrollable fits of rage that were often part of the transformation into a werewolf. From there it had been a short jump to Clary suggesting that Jace &#x201c;might as well try it,&#x201d; and here they were, at his second session. The first session had ended with Jace burning a mark into Simon and Jordan&#x2019;s hardwood floor, so Jordan had suggested they take it outside for the second round to prevent further property damage.<br> <br>&#x201c;No killing,&#x201d; Jordan said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re trying to make you feel peaceful. Blood, killing, war, those are all non-peaceful things. Isn&#x2019;t there anything else you like?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Weapons,&#x201d; said Jace. &#x201c;I like weapons.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m starting to think we have a problematic issue of personal philosophy here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace leaned forward, his palms flat on the grass. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a warrior,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I was brought up as a warrior. I didn&#x2019;t have toys, I had weapons. I slept with a wooden sword until I was five. My first books were medieval demonologies with illuminated pages. The first songs I learned were chants to banish demons. I know what brings me peace, and it isn&#x2019;t sandy beaches or chirping birds in rain forests. I want a weapon in my hand and a strategy to win.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jordan looked at him levelly. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re saying that what brings you peace is war.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace threw his hands up and stood, brushing grass off his jeans. &#x201c;Now you get it.&#x201d; He heard the crackle of dry grass and turned, in time to see Clary duck through a gap between two trees and emerge into the clearing, Simon only a few steps behind her. Clary had her hands in her back pockets and she was laughing.<br> <br>Jace watched them for a moment&#x2014;there was something about looking at people who didn&#x2019;t know they were being watched. He remembered the second time he had ever seen Clary, across the main room of Java Jones. She&#x2019;d been laughing and talking with Simon the way she was doing now. He remembered the unfamiliar twist of jealousy in his chest, pressing out his breath, the feeling of satisfaction when she&#x2019;d left Simon behind to come and talk to him.<br> <br>Things did change. He&#x2019;d gone from being eaten up with jealousy of Simon, to a grudging respect for his tenacity and courage, to actually considering him a friend, though he doubted he&#x2019;d ever say so out loud. Jace watched as Clary looked over and blew him a kiss, her red hair bouncing in its ponytail. She was so small&#x2014;delicate, doll-like, he had thought once, before he&#x2019;d learned how strong she was.<br> <br>She headed toward Jace and Jordan, leaving Simon to scamper up the rocky ground to where Alec and Isabelle were sitting; he collapsed beside Isabelle, who immediately leaned over to say something to him, her black curtain of hair hiding her face.<br> <br>Clary stopped in front of Jace, rocking back on her heels with a smile. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s it coming along?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jordan wants me to think about the beach,&#x201d; Jace said gloomily.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s stubborn,&#x201d; Clary said to Jordan. &#x201c;What he means is that he appreciates it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t, really,&#x201d; said Jace.<br> <br>Jordan snorted. &#x201c;Without me you&#x2019;d be bouncing down Madison Avenue, shooting sparks out of all your orifices.&#x201d; He rose to his feet, shrugging on his green jacket. &#x201c;Your boyfriend&#x2019;s crazy,&#x201d; he said to Clary.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but he&#x2019;s hot,&#x201d; said Clary. &#x201c;So there&#x2019;s that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jordan made a face, but it was good-natured. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m heading out,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Got to meet Maia downtown.&#x201d; He gave a mock salute and was gone, slipping into the trees and vanishing with the silent tread of the wolf he was under the skin. Jace watched him go. Unlikely saviors, he thought. Six months ago he wouldn&#x2019;t have believed anyone who&#x2019;d told him he was going to wind up taking behavioral lessons from a werewolf.<br> <br>Jordan and Simon and Jace had struck up something of a friendship in the past months. Jace couldn&#x2019;t help using their apartment as a refuge, away from the daily pressures of the Institute, away from the reminders that the Clave was still unprepared for war with Sebastian.<br> <br>Erchomai. The word brushed the back of Jace&#x2019;s mind like the touch of a feather, making him shiver. He saw an angel&#x2019;s wing, torn from its body, lying in a pool of golden blood.<br> <br>I am coming.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; Clary said; Jace suddenly looked a million miles away. Since the heavenly fire had entered his body, he&#x2019;d tended to drift off more into his head. She had a feeling that it was a side effect of suppressing his emotions. She felt a little pang&#x2014;Jace, when she had met him, had been so controlled, only a little of his real self leaking out through the cracks in his personal armor, like light through the chinks in a wall. It had taken a long time to break down those defenses. Now, though, the fire in his veins was forcing him to put them back up, to bite down on his emotions for safety&#x2019;s sake. But when the fire was gone, would he be able to dismantle them again?<br> <br>He blinked, called back by her voice. The winter sun was high and cold; it sharpened the bones of his face and threw the shadows under his eyes into relief. He reached for her hand, taking a deep breath. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; he said in the quiet, more serious voice he reserved only for her. &#x201c;It is helping&#x2014;the lessons with Jordan. It is helping, and I do appreciate it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Clary curled her hand around his wrist. His skin felt warm under her touch; he seemed to run several degrees hotter than normal since his encounter with Glorious. His heart still pounded its familiar, steady rhythm, but the blood being pushed through his veins seemed to thrum under her touch with the kinetic energy of a fire just about to catch.<br> <br>She went up on her toes to kiss his cheek, but he turned, and their lips brushed. They&#x2019;d done nothing more than kiss since the fire had first started singing in his blood, and they&#x2019;d done even that carefully. Jace was careful now, his mouth sliding softly against hers, his hand closing on her shoulder. For a moment they were body to body, and she felt the thrum and pulse of his blood. He moved to pull her closer, and a sharp, dry spark passed between them, like the zing of static electricity.<br> <br>Jace broke off the kiss and stepped back with an exhale; before Clary could say anything, a chorus of sarcastic applause broke out from the nearby hill. Simon, Isabelle, and Alec waved at them. Jace bowed while Clary stepped back slightly sheepishly, hooking her thumbs into the belt of her jeans.<br> <br>Jace sighed. &#x201c;Shall we join our annoying, voyeuristic friends?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Unfortunately, that&#x2019;s the only kind of friends we have.&#x201d; Clary bumped her shoulder against his arm, and they headed up toward the rocks. Simon and Isabelle were side by side, talking quietly. Alec was sitting a little apart, staring at the screen of his phone with an expression of intense concentration.<br> <br>Jace threw himself down next to his parabatai. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard that if you stare at those things enough, they&#x2019;ll ring.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s been texting Magnus,&#x201d; said Isabelle, glancing over with a disapproving look.<br> <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Alec said automatically.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, you have,&#x201d; said Jace, craning to look over Alec&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;And calling. I can see your outgoing calls.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s his birthday,&#x201d; Alec said, flipping the phone shut. He looked smaller these days, almost skinny in his worn blue pullover, holes at the elbows, his lips bitten and chapped. Clary&#x2019;s heart went out to him. He&#x2019;d spent the first week after Magnus had broken up with him in a sort of daze of sadness and disbelief. None of them could really believe it. She&#x2019;d always thought Magnus loved Alec, really loved him; clearly Alec had thought so too. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want him to think that I didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;to think that I forgot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re pining,&#x201d; said Jace.<br> <br>Alec shrugged. &#x201c;Look who&#x2019;s talking. &#x2018;Oh, I love her. Oh, she&#x2019;s my sister. Oh why, why, why&#x2014;&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>Jace threw a handful of dead leaves at Alec, making him splutter.<br> <br>Isabelle was laughing. &#x201c;You know he&#x2019;s right, Jace.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Give me your phone,&#x201d; Jace said, ignoring Isabelle. &#x201c;Come on, Alexander.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s none of your business,&#x201d; Alec said, holding the phone away. &#x201c;Just forget about it, okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t eat, you don&#x2019;t sleep, you stare at your phone, and I&#x2019;m supposed to forget about it?&#x201d; Jace said. There was a surprising amount of agitation in his voice; Clary knew how upset he&#x2019;d been that Alec was unhappy, but she wasn&#x2019;t sure Alec knew it. Under normal circumstances Jace would have killed, or at least threatened, anyone who hurt Alec; this was different. Jace liked to win, but you couldn&#x2019;t win out over a broken heart, even someone else&#x2019;s. Even someone you loved.<br> <br>Jace leaned over and grabbed the phone out of his parabatai&#x2019;s hand. Alec protested and reached for it, but Jace held him off with one hand, expertly scrolling through the messages on the phone with the other. &#x201c;Magnus, just call me back. I need to know if you&#x2019;re okay&#x2014;&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;Okay, no. Just no.&#x201d; With a decisive move he snapped the phone in half. The screen went blank as Jace dropped the pieces to the ground. &#x201c;There.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alec looked down at the shattered pieces in disbelief. &#x201c;You BROKE my PHONE.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace shrugged. &#x201c;Guys don&#x2019;t let other guys keep calling other guys. Okay, that came out wrong. Friends don&#x2019;t let friends keep calling their exes and hanging up. Seriously. You have to stop.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alec looked furious. &#x201c;So you broke my brand-new phone? Thanks a lot.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace smiled serenely and lay back on the rock. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Look on the bright side,&#x201d; Isabelle said. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t be able to get texts from Mom anymore. She&#x2019;s texted me six times today. I turned my phone off.&#x201d; She patted her pocket with a significant look.<br> <br>&#x201c;What does she want?&#x201d; Simon asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Constant meetings,&#x201d; Isabelle said. &#x201c;Depositions. The Clave keeps wanting to hear what happened when we fought Sebastian at the Burren. We&#x2019;ve all had to give accounts, like, fifty times. How Jace absorbed the heavenly fire from Glorious. Descriptions of the Dark Shadowhunters, the Infernal Cup, the weapons they used, the runes that were on them. What we were wearing, what Sebastian was wearing, what everyone was wearing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like phone sex but boring.&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon made a choking noise.<br> <br>&#x201c;What we think Sebastian wants,&#x201d; Alec added. &#x201c;When he&#x2019;ll come back. What he&#x2019;ll do when he does.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary leaned her elbows on her knees. &#x201c;Always good to know the Clave has a well-thought-out and reliable plan.&#x201d; For a moment she regretted her words, remembering that Robert Lightwood was the new Inquisitor. But his children didn&#x2019;t seem bothered by her comment in the least.<br> <br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t want to believe it,&#x201d; said Jace, staring at the sky. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the problem. No matter how many times we tell them what we saw at the Burren. No matter how many times we tell them how dangerous the Endarkened are. They don&#x2019;t want to believe that Nephilim could really be corrupted. That Shadowhunters could kill Shadowhunters.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary had been there when Sebastian had created the first of the Endarkened. She had seen the blankness in their eyes, the fury with which they&#x2019;d fought. They terrified her. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not Shadowhunters anymore,&#x201d; she added in a low voice. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not people.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to believe that if you haven&#x2019;t seen it,&#x201d; Alec said. &#x201c;And Sebastian has only so many of them. A small force, scattered&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t want to believe he&#x2019;s really a threat. Or if he is a threat, they&#x2019;d rather believe it was more a threat to us, to New York, than to Shadowhunters at large.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not wrong that if Sebastian cares about anything, it&#x2019;s about Clary,&#x201d; Jace said, and Clary felt a cold shiver at her spine, a mixture of disgust and apprehension. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t really have emotions. Not like we do. But if he did, he&#x2019;d have them about her. And he has them about Jocelyn. He hates her.&#x201d; He paused, thoughtful. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d be likely to strike directly here. Too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. obvious.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you told the Clave this,&#x201d; Simon said.<br> <br>&#x201c;About a thousand times,&#x201d; said Jace. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think they hold my insights in particularly high regard.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary looked down at her hands. She had been deposed by the Clave, just like the rest of them; she&#x2019;d given answers to all their questions. There were still things about Sebastian she hadn&#x2019;t told them, hadn&#x2019;t told anyone. The things he&#x2019;d said he wanted from her.<br> <br>She hadn&#x2019;t dreamed much since they&#x2019;d come back from the Burren with Jace&#x2019;s veins full of fire, but when she did have nightmares, they were about her brother.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like trying to fight a ghost,&#x201d; Jace said. &#x201c;They can&#x2019;t track Sebastian, they can&#x2019;t find him, they can&#x2019;t find the Shadowhunters he&#x2019;s turned.&#x201d;<br> <br>...</p><h2>Italian Hilltowns</h2><p>Illustrated throughout.

"Style is like a feather in a woman's hat, nothing more," said Le Corbusier, expressing most modern architects' low regard for the subject. But Witold Rybczynski disagrees, and in <em>The Look of Architecture</em>, he makes a compelling case for the importance of style to the mother of the arts.<br> This is a book brimming with sharp observations--that form does <em>not</em> follow function; that the best architecture is not timeless but precisely <em>of</em> its time; that details do not merely complement the architecture--details <em>are</em> the architecture. But the heart of the book illuminates the connection between architecture, interior decoration, and fashion. Style is the language of architecture, Rybczynski writes, and fashion represents the wide--and swirling--cultural currents that shape and direct that language. The two, style and fashion, are intimately linked--indeed, architecture cannot escape fashion. To set these ideas in sharp relief, he shows us how style and fashion have been expressed in the work of major architects--including Frank Gehry, Mies van der Rohe, Charles McKim, Allan Greenberg, Robert Venturi, Enrique Norten, and many others. He helps us see their works anew and ultimately to look afresh at our surroundings.<br> Style is one of the enduring--and endearing--aspects of architecture, Rybczynski concludes. Furthermore, an architecture that recognizes the importance of style would not be as introspective and self-referential as are so many contemporary buildings. It would be part of the world--not architecture for architects, but for the rest of us.</p><p><br><strong>Witold Rybczynski</strong> is one of America's best known writers on architecture, the author of the bestselling <em>One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw, Home, Waiting for the Weekend, The Most Beautiful House in the World</em>, and <em>A Clearing in the Distance</em>. He has also written on architecture for <em>The New York Times, The New Yorker, Time</em>, and <em>The New York Review of Books</em>. The Martin and Margy Meyerson Professor of Urbanism at the University of Pennsylvania, he lives in Philadelphia.<br>With his refusal to hide behind the jargon and hype endemic to the profession, and his ability to puncture its pretensions without mean-spiritedness, Rybczynski (Home: A Short History of an Idea) has become a leading writer on architecture. This concise survey of style in architecture is derived from three lectures the author gave in the New York Public Library, and the intimate, conversational tone he adopts manages to convey a lot of information in a very agreeable way. Indeed, Rybczynski's emphasis on style is itself provocative in a profession that has traditionally given such considerations short shrift. ("Style is like a feather in a woman's cap, nothing more," he finds Le Corbusier observing.) Add to this Rybczynski's referencing of interior design and fashion, and one has a book as iconoclastic as it is readable. Another great strength of the book is its delightfully discursive set pieces, including one on the buildings around Bryant Park this will have visitors to New York clutching this trim and portable book as they peer upwards at the rich mosaic of buildings so beautifully contextualized within. The range of the book is impressively wide, with many less familiar buildings (the Canadian Parliament buildings, the solidly elegant cottages of Alan Greenberg) given due consideration, and recent superstars such as Frank Gehry's Bilbao Guggenheim crisply observed. The author's deeply informed enthusiasm is infectious, and his removal of architectural writing from an airily theoretical discourse to the realm of practical experience is empowering for the lay reader. We all have to live in buildings, after all.

He hates America's shallow, mindless culture of vice and violence. <p> He is a devout Muslim.

He lives in New York City.Chapter 1 <br><br> Present Day<br><br> North-West Frontier, on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan<br><br> sheikh gul scowled at his congregation. &#x201c;These days every Muslim must fight jihad,&#x201d; he said in Pashtun, his voice rising. &#x201c;When the Mongols invaded Baghdad, it didn&#x2019;t help the people of Baghdad that they were pious Muslims. They died at the swords of the infidels.&#x201d;<br><br> The sheikh threw his hands over his head.<br><br> &#x201c;Now Islam is under siege again. Under siege in the land of the two mosques, and the land of the two rivers&#x201d;&#x2014;Saudi Arabia and Iraq. &#x201c;Under siege here in Pakistan, where our leader works for Americans and Jews. Everywhere we are under siege,&#x201d; said the sheikh, Mohammed Gul. He was a short, bearded man with a chunky body hidden under a smooth brown robe. His voice seemed to belong to someone much larger. Inside the mosque, a simple brick building whose walls were covered in flaking white paint, the worshippers murmured agreement and drew together. Brothers in arms. But their assent enraged the sheikh further.<br><br> &#x201c;You say, &#x2018;Yes, yes.&#x2019; But what do you do when prayers are finished? Do you sacrifice yourselves? You go home and do nothing. Muslims today love this world and hate death. We have abandoned jihad!&#x201d; the sheikh shouted. He stopped to look out over the crowd and wipe his brow. &#x201c;And so Allah has subjugated us. Only when we sacrifice ourselves will we restore glory to Islam. On that day Allah will finally smile on us.&#x201d;<br><br> Except it sounds like none of us will be around to see it, Wells thought. In the years that Wells had listened to Gul&#x2019;s sermons, the sheikh had gotten angrier and angrier. The source of his fury was easy to understand. September 11 had faded, and Islam&#x2019;s return to glory remained distant as ever. The Jews still ruled Israel. The Americans had installed a Shia government in Iraq, a country that had always been ruled by Sunnis. Yes, Shias were Muslim too. But Shia and Sunni Muslims had been at odds since the earliest days of Islam. To Osama and his fellow fundamentalist Sunnis&#x2014;sometimes called Wahhabis&#x2014;the Shia were little better than Jews.<br><br> Al Qaeda, &#x201c;the Base&#x201d; of the revolution, had never recovered from the loss of its own base in Afghanistan, Wells thought. When the Taliban fell, Qaeda&#x2019;s troops fled east to the North-West Frontier, the mountainous border of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Wells had narrowly escaped an American bomb at Tora Bora, the last big fight of the Afghan war. He liked to imagine that the bomb had been guided by Glen Holmes, who had swung it away from the hut where Wells hid.<br><br> But the United States hadn&#x2019;t closed the noose at Tora Bora, for reasons Wells had never understood. Thousands of jihadis escaped. In 2002, they reached the mountains of the North-West Frontier, so named by the British, since the area was the northwest border of colonial India. The North-West Frontier was a wild land ruled by Pashtuns, devout Muslims who supported Qaeda&#x2019;s brand of jihad, and was effectively closed to Pakistani and American soldiers. Even the Special Forces could operate there only for short stretches.<br><br> So Qaeda survived. But it did not thrive. Osama and his lieutenants scurried between holes, occasionally releasing tapes to rouse the faithful. Every few months the group launched an attack. It had blasted a train station in Madrid, blown up hotels in Egypt and subways in London, attacked oil workers in Saudi Arabia. In Iraq, it fought the American occupiers. But nothing that had shaken the world like September 11.<br><br> Meanwhile Wells and his fellow jihadis eked out a miserable existence. In theory, Qaeda&#x2019;s paymasters had arranged for Pashtun villagers to house them. In reality, they were a burden on desperately poor families. They had to earn their keep like everyone else. Wells and the half dozen Arabs living in this village, just outside Akora Khatak, survived on stale bread and scraps of lamb. Wells did not want to guess how much weight he had lost. He had hardly recognized himself the few times he had seen himself in a mirror. The bullet hole in his left arm had turned into a knot of scar tissue that ached unpredictably.<br><br> The winters were especially difficult, even for Wells, who had grown up playing in the Bitterroot Range on the Montana-Idaho border. The cold sank into his bones. He could only imagine what the Saudis thought. Lots of them had been martyred in these mountains, but not from bombs or bullets. They&#x2019;d died of pneumonia and altitude sickness and something that looked a lot like scurvy. They&#x2019;d died asking for their mothers, and a few had died cursing Osama and the awful place he&#x2019;d led them. Wells ate fresh fruit whenever he could, which wasn&#x2019;t often, and marveled at the toughness of the Pashtuns.<br><br> To keep sane he practiced his soldiering as much as possible. The local tribal leader had helped him set up a small firing range on flat ground a few miles outside the village. Every few weeks Wells rode out with a half dozen men and shot off as many rounds as he could spare. But he couldn&#x2019;t pretend he was doing anything more than passing time. They all were. If America vs. Qaeda were a Pop Warner football game, the refs would have invoked the mercy rule and ended it a long time ago.<br><br> Gul stepped into the crowd of worshippers. He looked at the men around him and spoke again, his voice low and intense. &#x201c;The time for speeches is done, brothers,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Allah willing, we will see action soon. May Allah bless all faithful Muslims. Amen.&#x201d;<br><br> The men clustered close to hug the sheikh. Waiting his turn, Wells wondered if Gul knew something or was just trying to rally the congregation. He poked with his tongue at a loose molar in the back of his mouth, sending a spurt of pain through his jaw. Dental care in the North-West Frontier left something to be desired. In a few weeks he would have to visit the medical clinic in Akora to have the tooth &#x201c;examined.&#x201d; Or maybe he&#x2019;d just find a pair of pliers and do the job himself.<br><br> Lately Wells had dreamed of leaving this place. He could hitch a ride to Peshawar, catch a bus to Islamabad, and knock on the front gate of the American embassy. Or, more accurately, knock on the roadblocks that kept a truck bomb from getting too close to the embassy&#x2019;s blastproof walls. A few minutes and he&#x2019;d be inside. A couple days and he&#x2019;d be home. No one would say he had failed. Not to his face, anyway. They&#x2019;d say he had done all he could, all anyone could. But somewhere inside he would know better. And he would never forgive himself.<br><br> Because this wasn&#x2019;t Pop Warner football. The mercy rule didn&#x2019;t exist. The men standing beside him in this mosque would happily give their lives to be remembered as martyrs. They were stuck in these mountains, but their goal remained unchanged. To punish the crusaders for their hubris. To take back Jerusalem. To kill Americans. Qaeda&#x2019;s desire to destroy was limited only by its resources. For now the group was weak, but that could change instantly. If Qaeda&#x2019;s assassins succeeded in killing Pakistan&#x2019;s president, the country might suddenly have a Wahhabi in charge. Then bin Laden would have a nuclear weapon to play with. An Islamic bomb. And sooner or later there would be a big hole in New York or London or Washington.<br><br> Anyway, living here had a few compensations. Wells had learned the Koran better than he ever expected. He had a sense of how monks had lived in the Middle Ages, copying Bibles by hand. He knew now how one book could become moral and spiritual guidance and entertainment all at once.<br><br> After so many years in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Wells found that his belief in Islam&#x2014;once just a cover story&#x2014;had turned real. The faith touched him in a way that Christianity never had. Wells had always been skeptical of religion. When he read the Koran at night on his bed alone he suffered the same doubts about its promises of paradise as he did when he read the apostles&#x2019; description of Christ rising from the dead. Yet he loved the Koran&#x2019;s exhortations that men should treat one another as brothers and give all they could to charity. The umma, the brotherhood, was real. He could walk into any house in this village and be offered a cup of hot sweet tea and a meal by a family that could barely feed its own children. And no one needed a priest&#x2019;s help to reach the divine in Islam; anyone who studied hard and was humble could seek enlightenment for himself.<br><br> But Islam&#x2019;s biggest strength was its greatest weakness, Wells thought. The religion&#x2019;s flexibility had made it a cloak for the anger of men tired of being ruled by America and the West. Islam was the Marxism of the twenty-first century, a cover for national liberation movements of all stripes. Except that the high priests of Marxism had never promised their followers rewards in the next world in exchange for their deaths in this one. Wahhabis like bin Laden had married their fury at the United States with a particularly nasty vision of Islam. They wanted to take the religion back to the seventh-century desert. They couldn&#x2019;t compete in the modern world, so they would pretend that it didn&#x2019;t exist. Or destroy it. Their anger resonated with hundreds of millions of desperately poor Muslims. But in Wells&#x2019;s eyes they had perverted the religion they claimed to represent. Islam wasn&#x2019;t incompatible with progress. In fact, Islamic nations had once been among the world&#x2019;s most advanced. Eight hundred years ago, as Christians burned witches, the Muslim Abbasids had built a university in Baghdad that held eighty thousand books. Then the Mongols had come. Things had gone downhill ever since.<br><br> Wells kept his views to himself. Publicly, he spent hours each day studying the Koran with Sheikh Gul and the clerics at the village madrassa. His Qaeda superiors had taken notice. And that was the other reason Wells stayed in the North-West Frontier. He believed that he had at last convinced Qaeda&#x2019;s leadership of his loyalty; the other jihadis in the village had begun to listen to him more carefully. Or so he hoped.<br><br> Wells&#x2019;s turn to greet Sheikh Gul had come. Wells patted his heart, a traditional sign of affection. &#x201c;Allahu akbar,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> &#x201c;Allahu akbar,&#x201d; said the sheikh. &#x201c;Will you come to the mosque tomorrow morning to study, Jalal?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I would be honored,&#x201d; Wells said.<br><br> &#x201c;Salaam alaikum.&#x201d; Peace be with you.<br><br> &#x201c;Alaikum salaam.&#x201d;<br><br> wells walked out of the mosque into the village&#x2019;s dusty main street. As he blinked in the weak spring sunlight, two bearded men walked toward him. Wells knew them vaguely, though not their names. They lived in the mountains, second-tier bodyguards for Osama.<br><br> &#x201c;Salaam alaikum, Jalal,&#x201d; they said.<br><br> &#x201c;Alaikum salaam.&#x201d;<br><br> The men tapped their chests in greeting.<br><br> &#x201c;I am Shihab,&#x201d; the shorter one said.<br><br> &#x201c;Bassim.&#x201d; The taller of the two, though Wells towered over him. His shoes were leather and his white robe clean; maybe life in the mountains had improved. Or maybe Osama was living in a village now.<br><br> &#x201c;Allahu akbar,&#x201d; Wells said.<br><br> &#x201c;Allahu akbar.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The mujaddid asks that you come with us,&#x201d; Bassim said. Mujaddid. The renewer, a man sent by Allah to lead Islam&#x2019;s renaissance. Bin Laden was the mujaddid.<br><br> &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; A battered Toyota Crown sedan was parked behind the men. It was the only car in the village that Wells didn&#x2019;t recognize, so it must be theirs. He stepped toward it. Bassim steered him away.<br><br> &#x201c;He asks that you pack a bag. With everything you own that you wish to keep.&#x201d;<br><br> The request was unexpected, but Wells merely nodded. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t take long,&#x201d; he said. They walked down an alley to the brick hut where Wells lived with three other jihadis.<br><br> Inside, Naji, a young Jordanian who had become Wells&#x2019;s best friend in the mountains, thumbed through a tattered magazine whose cover featured Imran Khan, a famous Pakistani cricketeer-turned-politician. In the corner a coffeepot boiled on a little steel stove.<br><br> &#x201c;Jalal,&#x201d; Naji said, &#x201c;have you found us any sponsors yet?&#x201d; For months, Naji and Wells had joked to each other about starting a cricket team for Qaeda, maybe getting corporate sponsorship: &#x201c;The Jihadis will blow you away.&#x201d; Wells wouldn&#x2019;t have made those jokes to anyone else. But Naji was more sophisticated than most jihadis. He had grown up in Amman, Jordan&#x2019;s capital, paradise compared to this village. And Wells had saved Naji&#x2019;s life the previous summer, stitching the Jordanian up after Afghan police shot him at a border checkpoint. Since then the two men had been able to talk openly about the frustrations of living in the North-West Frontier.<br><br> &#x201c;Soon,&#x201d; Wells said.<br><br> Hamra, Wells&#x2019;s cat, rubbed against his leg and jumped on the thin gray blanket that covered his narrow cot. She was a stray Wells had found two years before, skinny, red&#x2014;which explained her name; hamra means &#x201c;red&#x201d; in Arabic&#x2014;and a great leaper. She had chosen him. One winter morning she had followed him around the village, mewing pathetically, refusing to go away even when he shouted at her. He couldn&#x2019;t bear watching her starve, so despite warnings from his fellow villagers that one cat would soon turn into ten, he&#x2019;d taken her in.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello, Hamra,&#x201d; he said, petting her quickly as Bassim walked into the hut. Shihab followed, murmuring something to Bassim that Wells couldn&#x2019;t hear.<br><br> &#x201c;Bassim and Shihab&#x2014;Naji,&#x201d; Wells said.<br><br> &#x201c;Marhaba,&#x201d; Naji said. Hello. Shihab and Bassim ignored him.<br><br> &#x201c;Please, have coffee,&#x201d; Wells said.<br><br> &#x201c;We must leave soon,&#x201d; Bassim said.<br><br> &#x201c;Naji,&#x201d; Wells said. &#x201c;Can you leave us for a moment?&#x201d;<br><br> Naji looked at Bassim and Shihab. &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Nam.&#x201d;<br><br> As Naji walked out, Wells stopped him. &#x201c;Naji,&#x201d; Wells said. He ran his fingers over Hamra&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Take care of her while I&#x2019;m gone.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;When will you be back, Jalal?&#x201d;<br><br> Wells merely shook his head.<br><br> &#x201c;Hamdulillah, then,&#x201d; Naji said. Praise be to God, a traditional Arabic blessing. &#x201c;Masalaama.&#x201d; Good-bye.<br><br> &#x201c;Hamdulillah.&#x201d; They hugged, briefly, and Naji walked out.<br><br> bassim and shihab looked on as Wells grabbed a canvas bag from under his cot. He threw in the few ragged clothes he wanted: his spare robe, a pair of beaten sneakers, a faded green wool sweater, its threads loose. A world-band radio he&#x2019;d bought in Akora Khatak a year before, and a couple of spare batteries. The twelve thousand rupees&#x2014;about two hundred dollars&#x2014;he had saved. He didn&#x2019;t have much else. No photographs, no television, no books except the Koran and a couple of Islamic philosophy texts. He slipped those gently into the bag. And his guns, of course. He lay on the dirt floor and pulled his AK and his Makarov from under the bed.<br><br> &#x201c;Those you can leave, Jalal,&#x201d; Bassim said.<br><br> Wells could not remember the last time he had slept without a rifle. He would rather have left his clothes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather not.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t need them where you&#x2019;re going.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Rise and Fall of an American Army: U.S. Ground Forces in Vietnam, 1963-1973</h2><p><b>&#x201c;THE MEN WHO SACRIFICED FOR THEIR COUNTRY ARE RIGHTFULLY HERALDED . . .

My priests had bandaged the gaping wound on his forehead and smoothed the wrinkled skin as best as they could; they had dressed him with scraps of many-coloured cotton and threaded a jade bead through his lips &#x2013; preparing him for the long journey ahead. As High Priest for the Dead, it was now my responsibility to ease his passage into Mictlan, the underworld.<br><br>I slashed my earlobes and drew thorns through the wounds, collecting the dripping blood in a bowl, and started a litany for the Dead.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The river flows northward<br>The mountains crush, the mountains bind...&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Grey light suffused the shrine, the pillars and the walls fading away to reveal a much larger place, a cavern where everything found its end. The adobe floor glimmered as if underwater. And shadows trailed, darkening the painted frescoes on the walls &#x2013; singing a wordless lament, a song that twisted in my guts like a knife-stab. The underworld.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Obsidian shards are driven into your hands, into your feet,<br>Obsidian to tear, to rend<br>You must endure&#x2013;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The copper bells sewn on the entrance-curtain tinkled as someone drew it aside, and hurried footsteps echoed under the roof of the shrine. &#x201c;Acatl-<i>tzin</i>!&#x201d; Ichtaca called.<br>Startled, I stopped chanting &#x2013; and instinctively reached up, to quench the flow of blood from my earlobes before the atmosphere of Mictlan could overwhelm the shrine. With the disappearance of the living blood, the spell was broken, and the world sprang into sudden, painful focus.<br><br>I turned, then, not hiding my anger. A broken spell would have left a link to Mictlan &#x2013; a miasma that would only grow thicker as time passed, darkening the shrine, the pyramid it sat upon, and the entire temple complex until the place became unusable. &#x201c;I hope you have a good reason...&#x201d;<br><br>Ichtaca, the Fire Priest of the temple and my second-in-command, stood on the threshold &#x2013; his fingers clenched on the conch-shell around his neck. &#x201c;I apologise for interrupting you, Acatl-tzin, but he was most insistent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He?&#x201d;<br><br>The curtain twisted aside, and someone walked into the shrine: Yaotl. My heart sank. Yaotl never came for good news.<br><br>&#x201c;I apologise,&#x201d; Yaotl said, with a curt nod of his head towards the altar, though clearly he meant none of it. Yaotl answered only to his mistress, Ceyaxochitl; and she in turn, as Guardian of the Sacred Precinct and keeper of the invisible boundaries, answered only to Revered Speaker Ayaxacatl, the ruler of the Mexica Empire. &#x201c;But we need you.&#x201d;<br><br>Again? Even though I was High Priest for the Dead, it seemed that Ceyaxochitl still considered me little better than a slave, to be summoned whenever she wanted. &#x201c;What is it this time?&#x201d;<br><br>Yaotl&#x2019;s scarred face twisted in what might have been a smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s bad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; I said. I should have known better than to ask him about the nature of the emergency. Yaotl enjoyed keeping me in ignorance, probably as a way to compensate for his station as a slave. I snatched up my grey cotton cloak from the stone floor and wrapped it around my shoulders. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming. Ichtaca, can you take over for me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Yaotl waited for me outside the shrine, on the platform of the pyramid temple, his embroidered cloak fluttering in the breeze. We descended the stairs of the pyramid side by side, in silence. Beneath us, moonlight shone on the temple complex, a series of squat adobe buildings stretching around a courtyard. Even at this hour, priests for the Dead were awake, saying vigils, conducting examinations of the recently dead, and propitiating the rulers of the underworld: Mictlantecuhtli and his wife, Mictecacihuatl, Lord and Lady Death.<br><br>Further on was the vast expanse of the Sacred Precinct: the mass of temples, shrines and penitential palaces that formed the religious heart of the Mexica Empire. And, still further, the houses and fields and canals of the island-city of Tenochtitlan, thousands of small lights burning away under the stars and moon.<br><br>We walked from the bottom of the steps to the gates of my temple, and then onto the plaza of the Sacred Precinct. At this hour of the night, it was blessedly free of the crowds that congregated in the day, of all the souls eager to earn the favours of the gods. Only a few offering priests were still abroad, singing hymns; and a few, younger novice priests, completing their nightly run around the Precinct&#x2019;s Serpent Wall. The air was warm and heavy, a presage of the rains and of the maize harvest to come.<br><br>To my surprise, Yaotl did not lead me to the Imperial Palace. I&#x2019;d expected this mysterious summons to be about noblemen. The last time Ceyaxochitl had asked for me in the middle of the night, it had been for a party of drunk administrators who had managed to summon a beast of the shadows from Mictlan. We&#x2019;d spent a night tracking down the monster before killing it with obsidian knives.<br><br>Yaotl walked purposefully on the empty plaza, past the main temple complexes and the houses of elite warriors. I had thought that we were going to the temple of Toci, Grandmother Earth, but Yaotl bypassed it completely, and led me to a building in its shadow: something neither as tall nor as grand as the pyramid shrines, a subdued, sprawling affair of rooms opening on linked courtyards, adorned with frescoes of gods and goddesses.<br><br>The girls&#x2019; <i>calmecac</i>: the House of Tears, a school where the children of the wealthy, as well as those vowed to the priesthood, would receive their education. I had never been there; the clergy of Mictlantecuhtli was exclusively male, and I had trouble enough with our own students.<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t imagine, though, what kind of magical offences untrained girls would commit. &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; I asked Yaotl but, characteristically, he walked into the building without answering me.<br><br>I suppressed a sigh and followed him, bowing slightly to the priestess in feather regalia who kept vigil at the entrance.<br><br>Inside, all was quiet, but it was the heavy calm before the rains. As I crossed courtyard after courtyard, I met the disapproving glances of senior offering priestesses, and the curious gazes of young girls who stood on the threshold of their ground-floor dormitories.<br><br>Yaotl led me to a courtyard near the centre of the building. Two rooms with pillared entrances opened on this. He went towards the leftmost one and, pulling aside the curtain, motioned me into a wide room.<br><br>It seemed an ordinary place, a room like any other in the city: an entrance curtain set with bells, gently tinkling in the evening breeze, walls adorned with frescoes of gods &#x2013; and, in the centre, a simple reed sleeping mat framed by two wooden chests. Copal incense burnt in a clay brazier, bathing the room in a soft, fragrant light that stung my eyes. And everything, from the chests to the mat, reeked of magic: a pungent, acrid smell that clung to the walls and to the beaten-earth floor like a miasma.<br><br>That wasn&#x2019;t natural. Even in the calmecac, there were strictures on the use of the living blood, restrictions on the casting of spells. Furthermore this looked like the private room of a priestess, not a teaching room for adolescent girls.<br><br>&#x201c;What happened&#x2013;&#x201d; I started, turning to Yaotl.<br><br>But he was already halfway through the door. &#x201c;Stay here. I&#x2019;ll tell Mistress Ceyaxochitl you&#x2019;ve arrived, Acatl-tzin.&#x201d; In his mouth, even the tzin honorific sounded doubtful.<br><br>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; I said, but all that answered me was the sound of bells from the open door. I stood alone in that room, with no idea of why I was there at all.<br><br>Tlaloc&#x2019;s lightning strike Yaotl.<br><br>I looked again at the room, wondering what I could guess of the circumstances that had brought me here. It looked like a typical priestess&#x2019;s room: few adornments, the same rough sleeping mat and crude wicker chests found in any peasant&#x2019;s house. Only the frescoes bore witness to the wealth of the calmecac school, their colours vibrant in the soft light, every feature of the gods sharply delineated. The paintings represented Xochipilli, God of Youth and Games, and His Consort, Xochiquetzal, Goddess of Lust and Childbirth. They danced in a wide garden, in the midst of flowers. The Flower Prince held a rattle, His Consort a necklace of poinsettias as red as a sacrifice&#x2019;s blood.<br><br>Dark stains marred the faces of both gods. No, not only the faces, every part of Their apparel from Their feathered headdresses to Their clawed hands. Carefully, I scraped off one of the stains and rubbed it between my fingers. Blood.<br><br>Dried blood. I stared at the floor again &#x2013; at what I had taken for dark earth in the dim light of the brazier. The stain was huge &#x2013; spreading over the whole room, soaking the earth so thoroughly it had changed its colour. I&#x2019;d attended enough sacrifices and examinations to know the amount of blood in the human body, and I suspected that the stain represented more than half of that. What in the Fifth World had happened here?<br><br>I stood in the centre of the room and closed my eyes. Carefully, I extended my priest-senses and probed at the magic, trying to see its nature. Underworld magic, yet... no, not quite. It was human, and it had been summoned in anger, in rage, an emotion that still hung in the room like a pall. But it didn&#x2019;t have the sickly, spread-out feeling of most underworld magic. Not a beast of shadows, then.<br><br><i>Nahual</i>. It had to be nahual magic: a protective jaguar spirit summoned in the room. Judging by the amount of blood in the vicinity, it had done much damage. Who, or what, had been wounded here?<br><br>I had been remiss in not taking any supplies before leaving my temple &#x2013; trusting Yaotl to provide what I needed, which was always a mistake with the wily slave. I had no animal sacrifices, nothing to practise the magic of living blood.<br><br>No, not quite. I did have one source of living blood: my own body. With only my blood, I might not be able to perform a powerful spell; but there <i>was</i> a way to know whether someone had died in this room. Death opened a gate into Mictlan, the underworld, and the memory of that gate would still be in the room. Accessing it wouldn&#x2019;t be a pleasant experience, but Huitzilpochtli, the Southern Hummingbird, blind me if I let Ceyaxochitl manipulate me once more.<br><br>I withdrew one of the obsidian blades that I always carried in my belt, and nicked my right earlobe with it. I&#x2019;d done it so often that I barely flinched at the pain that spread upwards, through my ear. Blood dripped, slowly, steadily, onto the blade &#x2013; each drop, pulsing on the rhythm of my heartbeat, sending a small shock through the hilt when it connected with the obsidian.<br><br>I brought the tip of the knife in contact with my own hand, and carefully drew the shape of a human skull. As I did so, I sang a litany to my patron Mictlantecuhtli, God of the Dead:<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Like the feathers of a precious bird<br>That precious bird with the emerald tail<br>We all come to an end<br>Like a flower<br>We dry up, we wither...&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A cold wind blew across the room, lifting the entrance-curtain &#x2013; the tinkle of the bells was muffled, as if coming from far away, and the walls of the room slowly receded, revealing only darkness &#x2013; but odd, misshapen shadows slid in and out of my field of vision, waiting for their chance to leap, to tear, to feast on my beating heart.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We reach the land of the fleshless<br>Where jade turns to dust<br>Where feathers crumble into ash<br>Where our flowers, our songs are forever extinguished<br>Where all the tears rain down...&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A crack shimmered into existence, in the centre of the chamber: the entrance to a deep cavern, a <i>cenote</i>, at the bottom of which dark, brackish water shimmered in cold moonlight. Dry, wizened silhouettes splashed through the lake &#x2013; the souls of the Dead, growing smaller and smaller the farther they went, like children&#x2019;s discarded toys. They sang as they walked: cold whispers, threads of sound which curled around me, clinging to my naked skin like snakes. I could barely make out the words, but surely, if I stayed longer, if I bent over the cenote until I could see the bottom of the water...<br><br>If I...<br><br>No. I wasn&#x2019;t that kind of fool.<br><br>With the ease of practise, I passed the flat of the knife across the palm of my other hand &#x2013; focusing on nothing but the movement of the blade until the image of the skull was completely erased.<br><br>When I raised my eyes again, the crack had closed. The walls were back, with the vivid, reassuring colours of the frescoes; and the song of the Dead had faded into the whistle of the wind through the trees of the courtyard outside.<br><br>I stood, for a while, breathing hard &#x2013; it never got any easier to deal with the underworld, no matter how used to it you became. Still...<br><br>I had seen the bottom of the cenote, and the Dead making their slow way to the throne of Lord Death. I had not, however, made out the words of their song. The gate to Mictlan had been widening, but not yet completely open. That meant someone in this room had been gravely wounded, but they were still alive.<br><br>No, that was too hasty. Whoever had been wounded in this room hadn&#x2019;t died within &#x2013; yet I didn&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;d have survived for long, unless they&#x2019;d found a healer.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, Acatl,&#x201d; Ceyaxochitl said, behind me. &#x201c;That was fast.&#x201d;<br><br>I turned much faster than I&#x2019;d have liked. With the memory of Mictlan&#x2019;s touch on my skin, any noise from the human world sounded jarringly out of place.<br><br>Ceyaxochitl stood limned in the entrance, leaning on her wooden cane. She was wearing a headdress of blue feathers that spread like a fan over her forehead, and a dress embroidered with the fused-lovers insignia of the Duality. Her face was smooth, expressionless, as it always was.<br><br>I&#x2019;d tensed, even though she had barely spoken to me, preparing for another verbal sparring. Ceyaxochitl had a habit of moving people like pawns in a game of <i>patolli</i>, deciding what she thought was in their best interests without preoccupying herself much with their opinions, and I seldom enjoyed being the target of her attentions.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t particularly appreciate being summoned like this,&#x201d; I started to say, but she shook her head, obviously amused.<br><br>&#x201c;You were awake, Acatl. I know you.&#x201d;<br><br>Yes, she knew me, all too well. After all, we had worked together for roughly nine years, the greater part of my adult life. She had been the one to campaign at the Imperial Court for my nomination as High Priest for the Dead, a position I neither wanted nor felt comfortable with &#x2013; another of her interferences in my life. We&#x2019;d made a kind of uneasy peace over the matter in the last few months, but right now she was going too far.<br><br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; I said. I brushed off the dried blood on my fingers, and watched her hobble into the room. &#x201c;Now that I&#x2019;m here, can we dispense with the formalities? Who was wounded here, Ceyaxochitl?&#x201d;<br><br>She paused for a moment, though she barely showed any surprises. &#x201c;Hard at work, I s...</p></p><h2>Secure in the Everlasting Arms</h2><p>"Elisabeth Elliot is a woman set apart by the Spirit of God. Her voice has been a trusted source of godly wisdom and encouragement in our home for more than thirty years."--Dennis and Barbara Rainey, Family Life<br><br>In a life filled with uncertainty, Elisabeth Elliot clings to the God who never leaves her side. Through the deaths of two husbands, a life of travel and danger, and the raising of her daughter as a single parent, God provided Elliot with a security that could not have come from relying on the world. Readers have a rich opportunity to join this former missionary as she recounts some of the amazing events of her life and her reliance on God.</p><p>Because God&#x2019;s all-encompassing love has become the theme of her long life, Elisabeth Elliot chose to open her daily thirteen-year radio program, Gateway to Joy, with her signature line, "underneath are the everlasting arms." Now she has gathered into this new book many of her reflections, previously published only in The Elisabeth Elliot Newsletter. The author&#x2019;s thoughtful mini-essays are vintage Elisabeth Elliot, conveying the reader from her school years through expeditions to exotic foreign destinations, returning to her comfortable home in Massachusetts. Her perennial themes of contentment, joy in the midst of sorrow, and abiding daily faith reveal the heart of God the Father and a life well-lived.<b>Elisabeth Elliot</b> (1926-2015) was one of the most perceptive and popular Christian writers of the last century. The author of more than twenty books, including <i>Passion and Purity</i>, <i>The Journals of Jim Elliot</i>, and <i>These Strange Ashes</i>, Elliot offered guidance and encouragement to millions of readers worldwide.</p><h2>Over the Rivers (An Aerial View of Geology)</h2><p><p> <i>The science of the Earth in all its splendor.</i> </p><p> <b>Over the Rivers</b> is the second volume in the exciting <i>Aerial View of Geology</i> series (the first was the highly praised <i>Over the Mountains</i>). As as a geologist, one of America's premier aerial photographers and a gifted science writer, Michael Collier is exceptionally well qualified to present these spectacular landscapes and stunning aerial photographs that vividly demonstrate geological processes. </p><p> Vivid text and clear captions guide readers through the exciting photographs, enhancing their understanding of fundamental geological processes. Collier explores, for example:</p><ul> <li>How a 6,000-foot-deep canyon was carved out by the erosive power of a single river</li> <li>How violent tectonic forces millions of years ago vaulted a river over a mountain</li> <li>Why one river takes its time meandering, another suddenly drops over a cliff, and a third slowly separates into a sprawling delta.</li> </ul><p> <b>Over the Rivers</b> inspires as it informs, and dazzles as it enlightens. </p></p><p><p> <b>Michael Collier</b> has written 14 books on geological themes. In 2005, the American Geological Institute honored his work with its prestigious Outstanding Contribution to Public Understanding of Geosciences Award. </p><p> An exhibition of Michael Collier's aerial views of geology will be held at the Houston Museum of Natural Science (September 13, 2008-March 1, 2009) and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science (March 15-August 1, 2009). </p><p><b>Waiting to Row</b></p> <p>Rivers flow from the mountains to the sea. Nothing could be simpler; nothing could be more complex.</p> <p>To understand rivers, we should start at the beginning, in the oceans. Ours is a blue planet where water covers almost three-quarters of the surface. If seawater, all 326 million cubic miles of it, simply stayed in the oceans, there would be no rainfall, no rivers. But the sun's heat evaporates seawater, every year lifting something like 77 thousand cubic miles of water into the atmosphere. Most condenses nearby and just falls back into the oceans. But a third of that evaporated water rises high enough and is carried far enough to fall on land. And with that rain, our story begins.</p> <p>Earth's atmosphere is capable of transporting prodigious quantities of water. Forty weeks of intense rainfall throughout the American Midwest set the stage for the Mississippi River's great flood of 1993 -- a volume of rainfall equivalent to twice the size of Lake Erie. On the other hand, parts of California's Death Valley can be bone dry for a year or more. On average, that region of the Mojave Desert receives only an inch and three-quarters of rain annually.</p> <p>If precipitation were equally distributed, every place on earth would receive thirty-one inches of rain each year. But local conditions wring variable amounts of moisture from the air. As any frustrated farmer knows, water vapor can remain suspended within clouds as they blow on by, perhaps to fall downwind on some other farmer's field. Proximity to an ocean can increase rainfall. For instance, the Pacific aims its moisture squarely at Yakutat, an Alaskan coastal town that receives more than 150 inches of rain -- ten feet -- each year. Precipitation is also likely to be higher near mountains like the Sierra Nevada, where the atmosphere is lifted and cooled as it flows inland. Finally, rain can be wrung from the skies when air masses collide. This occurred in the 1993 Mississippi River flood when cold Canadian air repeatedly encountered moist warm Gulf air over the Midwest.</p> <p>Death Valley and Yakutat highlight meteorologic extremes. Perhaps it's more useful to squint at a map of the United States and try to see generalized precipitation patterns. The first and most obvious observation is that rainfall increases from west to east across the country. Eastern seaboard states typically receive 40 to 50 inches of rain a year. Farmers across the Great Plains can reasonably hope for 30 to 40 inches each year. But west of the 100th Meridian, in Kansas, annual rainfall steadily decreases -- 14 inches in Denver, and seven or eight in Phoenix.</p> <p>Rain may fall, but we still don't have a river. Once it strikes the earth, precipitation can follow one of three paths: water can evaporate and rise back into the atmosphere, it can flow along the surface, or it can sink into the ground. A surprising amount reenters the atmosphere. Evaporation occurs directly from standing bodies of water like puddles or lakes. In some areas evaporation directly from the leaves of trees or crops can be as high as 30 percent of total rainfall. Additionally, plant roots intercept water that has just begun to soak into the ground. This moisture will be carried upward and released back through leaves -- a biologically essential process known as transpiration. Taken together, evaporation and transpiration return as much as 70 percent of a region's rainfall back to the atmosphere.</p> <p>The remaining fraction of rainfall will either percolate into the ground or flow across the surface. Rates of percolation are highly variable, depending on the texture of the ground: porous soil versus fractured rock, absorbent sand versus watertight clay. Once underground, water flows very slowly-maybe 100 feet a year. Eventually groundwater collects in underground reservoirs called aquifers. During a heavy storm, soil can become saturated with rain that has already fallen. When water can no longer be absorbed, it must flow above ground. Water flowing overland combines with springs bubbling up from below to create first a trickle, a brook, then a stream, and finally a river.</p> <p>Rivers may be the lifeblood of a landscape, but they represent a surprisingly small fraction of the earth's water. Of all water-within the oceans, floating in the atmosphere, locked up as glacial ice, hiding in underground aquifers, or biding its time in lakes -- streams and rivers account for only 0.0001% of the total on earth. But this percentage, tiny as it may be, has shaped the world in which we live. Farms have always sprouted where water is most readily available. Cities, dependent on easy transportation, long ago sprang up on the shores of major waterways.</p> <p>A river is living water. Stand on the bank, look upstream and down, and savor the sense of living water. Every river is the center of a universe where change is a constant. Is the river rising or falling? Is the surface smooth and glistening, or is it chewed into currents and chopped into waves? Is the river clear today, or still muddy from yesterday's storm? Look upstream for the tenth time this hour -- is the boat coming down yet? Look downstream -- are the salmon still running? The splash and chuckle of a living river tells a landscape's most vivid stories; a river spawns a landscape's wildest dreams.</p> <p>I learned about moving water while working on the Colorado River, rowing in the 1970s and 1980s through Arizona's Grand Canyon. If that river didn't teach me everything that I know, at least it put it all into perspective. I grew out of adolescence and into manhood on the Colorado, an oar in each hand. I'd tuck those oars under my knees and lean back against the raft's load. I was intoxicated, watching sun-spangled canyon walls spin circles around an impossibly blue sky. Sometimes my passengers would self-consciously clear their throats as we bore down on a rapid -- they seemed more comfortable when I paid attention to the ominous growl of waves beating against rocks.</p> <p>My pulse quickened whenever we slid into Hance or Horn, Serpentine or Sockdolager Rapids. Ninety-eight miles into the Grand Canyon, the Colorado's muscular surface flexed and freshened as it rolled over the debris fan that forms Crystal Rapid. I'd already memorized every rock and wave that loomed downstream. We swept quickly past the last point where I might have rowed to shore and reconsidered this madness. Accelerating into the turmoil, I waited. There was absolutely nothing to be done for the next ten seconds -- agonizing moments that stretched into infinity. On Crystal's tongue, the smooth surface of the river began to heave and shudder, but still I took no strokes. To start rowing even a second too soon, to strike a rock instead of sliding behind it, was to court disaster. Wait. Listen.</p> <p>Wait.</p> <p>NOW!</p> <p>With all my strength I pulled downstream and to the right. The boat slid off the current and cut into the slack water directly behind a granite boulder. The passengers didn't know it, but we'd already run the real rapid. The titillation of waves and rough water would follow soon enough. But for me, the most breathtaking part of river running was always that moment out on a rapid's tongue, oars suspended, waiting for the precise instant when I could take that first strategic stroke. </p> <p>I've since moved downstream -- studied geology, learned to fly, survived medical school. But I haven't forgotten those lessons learned on the water, those prayers offered to the river. I never nose my airplane over into stormy turbulence, never walk into a medical maelstrom without remembering how it was once to slide down the tongue, oars motionless, waiting to row.</p> <p>This book examines the ways in which rivers rise and flow, the means with which they erode and shape landscapes, and the ways in which landscapes in turn mold rivers. I learned rivers from water level, but I tell their stories now from the air. From the cockpit of my plane I can sometimes see most of a river basin from a single vantage point -- its headwaters in the distance, valley below, and mouth at sea level.

When he remonstrates, they suggest that if Francis cannot adapt to the new rules and regulations, perhaps he should go elsewhere.<br> Rejected by the order which he founded and despondent that the vision he felt God gave him is being scorned, Francis withdraws to a mountain hermitage with his beloved Brother Leo. There in a Spartan cave during a long winter of the soul Francis arrives at new insights into what God requires of those who would follow Christ.<br> This heartening story brings comfort to all who have faced loss or failure and feel that God is no longer smiling with favor on them.

Fremont's tender but unsparing memoir chronicles the voyage of discovery she took with her older sister, ferreting out information from Jewish organizations and individuals and worrying about its impact on their angry, overpowering father and reticent, nightmare-plagued mother. Fremont has the courage to paint a nearly unsympathetic portrait of her parents' secretiveness and initial reluctance to have their children dredge up the past; as the narrative unfolds, readers comprehend the tormented roots of their behavior without forgetting the psychological problems it created for their daughters. Fremont's re-creation of her parents' ghastly ordeals--her mother narrowly escaping the murder of nearly every Jew in her hometown; her father surviving six years in the Soviet gulag--is a triumph of dogged research and sympathetic imagination. Her book tells a deeply American story of identity lost and reclaimed, complete with Fremont coming out to her parents as a lesbian, yet it also achieves understanding of the dark European past and its icy grip on her family. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"[A]n incredible tale of survival, a beautiful love story...a triumphant work of art."<br>--<b>Publishers Weekly</b>, starred review<br><br>"Few writers have imagined the lives of their parents as fully and richly as Helen Fremont has done in <b>After Long Silence</b>.

When the capital is moved to Philadelphia, the Washingtons and Oney move, too, and there Oney meets free blacks for the first time. At first Oney can't imagine being free &#x2013; she depends on the Washingtons for food, warmth, and clothing. But then Mrs. Washington tells Oney that after her death she will be sent to live with Mrs. Washington's granddaughter. Oney is horrified because she knows it is likely that she will then be sold to a stranger &#x2013; the worst fate she can imagine. Oney realizes she must run. One day she sees an opportunity and takes it, ending up in New Hampshire, where she lives the rest of her life, poor but free.</p><p>Pen-and-ink and watercolor illustrations bring to life this picture book biography of Oney Judge, a young woman who, in the end, has no mistress but herself.</p><p><i>The Escape of Oney Judge</i> is a 2008 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p><p>EMILY ARNOLD MCCULLY has written and illustrated many children's books, including <i>Mirette on the High Wire</i>, a Caldecott Medal Book, <i>Marvelous Mattie</i>, and <i>Squirrel and John Muir</i>, an NCSS-CBC Notable Trade Book in the Field of Social Studies. She divides her time between New York City and upstate New York.</p>*Starred Review* Children familiar with the sterling qualities of George Washington, and to a lesser degree, Martha, may be startled to learn that both were slaveholders--Martha's inherited from her first husband. Martha takes an interest in one of her slaves, 10-year-old Oney, allowing her to become one of Mount Vernon's seamstresses. When Washington becomes president, Oney moves with the family to Philadelphia and, for the first time, meets free blacks and Quakers who are agitating for emancipation. As a young woman, Oney learns she will be given to one of her mistress's relatives after Martha's death, so Oney decides to run away. She makes her way to New Hampshire, where she eventually marries. At the top of her game, McCully takes a rather sophisticated piece of history and writes it in a way that will draw in children. They'll understand that although Oney's existence as a slave is better than most, it's punctuated by incidents that show that her life isn't her own: Martha turns down Oney's request to earn extra money as a seamstress and laughs merrily at Oney's desire to read. Even after Oney is free, she fears being tricked or taken back by the Washingtons, who never quite forget about her. The bright, eye-catching watercolor-and-ink artwork makes the story even more accessible, and an informative note adds to the text. Fascinating history. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Excerpts from the writing of Ernest Hemingway, Toni Morrison, Graham Greene and Jane Bowles combine with over 150 recipes to capture the mood of life in the tropics. Divided into chapters on daiquiris, rum drinks, tequila and mescal drinks, fruit punches, and non-alcoholic drinks, the recipes in this book include swimming pool coladas, West Indian punch and frozen matadors, as well as more common concoctions. Directions on setting up a tropical bar, glossaries of spices, additives and tropical fruits, and the discussion of liquors themselves and their distillation process are also included. The recipes is illustrated with Gunter Mattei&#39;s hand-coloured engravings evoking the mystique of the Caribbean and the romantic associations of the grandeur of the islands.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanAficionados of rum drinks will relish this book, an unusual blend of historical sketches about rum, recommended basic necessities for the tropical bar, alcohol-inspired short stories and 152 recipes. Most of the last are based on rum, but a sprinkling of drinks using tequila, mescal or cachaca is included. Everyone will recognize a few of the 152 (all of which sound worth testing at least once)--but more are novel, collected from tiny, tin-roofed, palm-shaded tabernas on the Caribbean islands or invented by the author. The stories by Ernest Hemingway ("Daiquiris"), Jane Bowles ("Punch and Profit"), Malcolm Lowry and others, set in the tropics and peppered with bars and bordellos, are not necessarily these writers' best work; some are grim, rather at odds with a book implying the joys of a fruit-filled rum drink. But Mattei's full-color illustrations are provocatively lush, delicately mythic and pleasantly unsettling. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Chinese Ivory Carvings: The Sir Victor Sassoon Collection</h2><p>�Features over 350 exquisite ivories, the most notable artifacts in Sassoon&#39;s important collection�Essays written by experts in their fields place the objects in their historical context, making this a book that is both accessible and enlightening�Perfect for anyone interested in Asian art, the history of collecting, or the rich and varied relationship between East and West in the 20th centurySir Victor Sassoon (1881-1961) lived an extraordinary and colorful life and left a remarkable legacy. He created a trust to preserve his collection of ivories for the benefit of UK citizens. Since its foundation and under the guardianship of the dedicated trustees, the collection has grown by the addition of significant specimens that originally went unrepresented. Chinese Ivory Carvings presents 350 of the most significant artifacts, each illustrated and discussed, from Sassoon&#39;s extensive collection. Four introductory essays explore the acquisition of the pieces, placing the ivories in their historical and cultural context. In this scholarly celebration of Sassoon&#39;s bequest, one can appreciate some of the many facets of Chinese culture both religious and secular. Including minutely carved &#39;devil&#39;s work&#39; spheres, massive figures and exuberantly carved vases, the book is also testament to the technical skills of the craftsmen who produced these wonderful objects.</p><p>Rose Kerr is former Keeper of the Far Eastern Department at the V&amp;A.

Cobb is the author of three Amanda Lee Garrett thrillers-<i>Sea Fighter</i>, <i>Sea Strike</i>, and <i>Choosers of the Slain</i>-and is an avid student of military history and technology. He is a member of the United States Naval Institute and the Navy League.The romantically unflappable Amanda Garrett, the maritime commander of Cobb's action-at-sea series, falls out of character and into the arms of a modern-day pirate on her latest voyage. Garrett, leader of an elite navy strike force known as the Sea Fighters, is called to arms after pirates lay siege to a U.S. research vessel in the Indonesian Sea and steal a satellite that contains military secrets. Assisted by her able crew aboard the high-tech destroyer USS Cunningham, Garrett quickly determines that the satellite thieves are part of a huge organization of oceanic marauders led by the dashing Makara Harconan. While in pursuit, however, Garrett allows herself to be not only seduced but also kidnapped by Harconan, who takes her to his secret hideout where, coincidentally, the satellite is also stored. Garrett's poor judgment forces the Sea Fighters to turn a simple seek-and-recovery job into a damsel-in-distress rescue mission. Cobb's fourth Garrett adventure (Sea Fighter; Sea Strike), set in 2008, packs plenty of hard-charging Neptunian spirit and features dogged sea battles and interesting historical asides about Indonesia and piracy. Garrett's weakness for the archipelago's Svengali, however, not only is odd considering her previous guts-and-glory determination but gives an otherwise steely plot a squishy core. Cobb's hand at suspense slips a bit here, too: although they lose their commander for a time, nothing really comes too hard for the Sea Fighters. (Feb.)Forecast: Most Cobb fans will throw up their hands at their heroine's slip into romance; a few will enjoy the diversion. This isn't one of Cobb's best efforts, but the franchise is still seaworthy.<p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Jennifer Bartlett</h2><p>Jennifer Losch Bartlett (b. 1941) is an American artist. She emerged as one of the most important artists of the 1980s. She is known for paintings and prints that combine the system-based aesthetic of Conceptual art with the painterly approach of Neo-expressionism. Many of her pieces are executed on small, square, enamel-coated steel plates that are combined in grid formations to create very large works. In JENNIFER BARTLETT, Marge Goldwater, curator of the exhibition for the Walker Art Center, has contributed a chronological survey of the paintings that discusses the polarities of control and passion - the desire to master space, media, subject matter, and draftsmanship that are crucial aspects of the painter's art. In a richly illustrated article, New York art critic Roberta Smith discusses Bartlett's many architectural commissions. These remarkable installations range from a dining room in the home of British collectors Doris and Charles Saatchi - in which Bartlett employed no fewer than ten materials including a lacquer screen, mirrors, ceramic and enamel tiles - to Bartlett's other commissions - her work for Philip Johnson's AT&amp;T Building, and her tour de force multi-media installation at the Volvo Corporation headquarters in G�teborg, Sweden.</p><p></p><h2>The Magician&#39;s Nephew (The Chronicles of Narnia Facsimile)</h2><p>The Magician&#x2019;s Nephew is now repackaged in an unjacketed paper-over-board edition with black-and-white Pauline Baynes&#x2019; artwork in the interior and the iconic Chris Van Allsburg artwork on the cover.</p><p>This large, deluxe hardcover edition of the first title in the classic Chronicles of Narnia series, <i>The Magician's Nephew</i>, is a gorgeous introduction to the magical land of Narnia.

To aid in his search, Soth assumed the increasingly obsolescent role of community newspaper reporter. From 2012-2014, Soth traveled state by state while working on his self-published newspaper, The LBM Dispatch, as well as on assignment for the New York Times and others. From upstate New York to Silicon Valley, Soth attended hundreds of meetings, dances, festivals and communal gatherings in search of human interaction in an era of virtual social networks. With Songbook, Soth has stripped these pictures of their news context in order to highlight the longing for connection at their root. Fragmentary, funny and sad, Songbook is a lyrical depiction of the tension between American individualism and the desire to be united. Alec Soth (b. 1969) is a photographer born and based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His photographs have been featured in numerous solo and group exhibitions, including the 2004 Whitney and Sao Paulo Biennials. In 2008, a survey exhibition of Soth&#39;s work was exhibited at Jeu de Paume in Paris and Fotomuseum Winterthur in Switzerland. In 2010, the Walker Art Center produced a traveling survey exhibition of Soth&#39;s work entitled From Here To There. Soth has been the recipient of numerous fellowships and awards, including the Guggenheim Fellowship (2013). In 2008, Soth founded his own publishing company, Little Brown Mushroom. Soth is represented by Sean Kelly in New York, Weinstein Gallery in Minneapolis, Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco, and is a member of Magnum Photos.</p><p></p><h2>Gary Panter (PICTUREBOX)</h2><p>An intimate look at the work and life of a legendary artist. Gary Panter has been one of the most influential figures in visual culture since the mid-1970s. From his era-defining punk graphics to his cartoon icon Jimbo to his visionary design for <i>Pee-wee's Playhouse</i>, he has left his mark on every medium he's touched. Working in close collaboration with the artist, PictureBox has assembled the definitive volume on Panter's work from the early 1970s to the present. This monumental, slipcased set is split into two 350-page volumes. The first is a comprehensive monograph featuring over 700 images of paintings, drawings, sculptures, posters and comics, alongside essays by Robert Storr, Mike Kelley, Richard Klein, Richard Gehr, Karrie Jacobs and Byron Coley, as well a substantial commentary by the artist himself. The second volume features a selection from Panter's sketchbooks--the site of some of his most audacious work--most of which has never been published in any form.<br>A three-time Emmy Award-winner for his production design on <i>Pee-wee's Playhouse</i> and the recipient of the 2000 Chrysler Award for Design Excellence, graphic artist <b>Gary Panter</b> has drawn inspiration from diverse vernacular and traditional art arenas over the course of the past four decades. Closely associated with the underground comics and music scenes on both coasts, he is responsible for designing the Screamers iconic 1970s poster, many record covers for Frank Zappa, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Residents and the ongoing comic character Jimbo. Most recently Panter has performed psychedelic light shows at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. and at New York's Anthology Film Archives. He was a featured artist in the major 2006-2007 touring exhibition, <i>Masters of American Comics</i>.</p><p><b>Mike Kelley</b>, one of the most controversial, prolific and influential figures in contemporary art, was born in 1954 in Detroit, Michigan, and earned a Bachelors degree from the University of Michigan and a Masters from California Institute of the Arts. His work, often wickedly humorous and drawing on both high art and the vernacular with distinctively American iconography, ranges across media such as drawing, painting, sculpture, music, performance, writing and video projects, the last often in collaboration with artists such as Paul McCarthy, Raymond Pettibon and Tony Oursler. In 1993, The Whitney Museum of American Art held a major retrospective of his work. He lives in Los Angeles, and is a member of the graduate faculty at Art Center College of Design, Pasadena."...Panter - an artist, illustrator, set designer ("Pee-wee's Playhouse"), comic-book author and toymaker - deserves his new two-volume, boxed-set monograph. GARY PANTER (PictureBox/D.A.P., $95), edited by Dan Nadel and designed by Helene Silverman, is so rich in perversely witty imagery and raw lunatic expression that to savor it all requires spending considerable time thumbing through, then going back to focus on the details." --<b><i>Steven Heller The New York Times Book Review </i></b><br><br>"Best First "Big Show": Panter isn't just a legendary underground comic-book artist and the guy who created the sets for Pee-wee's Playhouse; he's also a painter. For his Clementine Gallery retrospective, "Pictures From the Psychedelic Swamp, 1972-2001," Panter covered the walls with recurring characters (like his "post-nuclear punk-rock" dude named Jimbo) and curated a room with the quirky ephemera that's inspired his work (soap wrappers, Japanese candy, wet paint signs). "Show" is probably the wrong word for what was on view here: It was more like walking into Panter's messy, expressionistic, and entirely original brain." --New York Magazine, December 12, 2008</p><h2>Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion (Philosophy of Religion)</h2><p>First published in 1980, and now substantially revised and enlarged, this panoramic survey of philosophic and religious thought, both ancient and modern, provides access to a wide array of ideas. More than just a dictionary, this well-designed reference work contains analytical commentary and historical accounts on a vast range of topics, select bibliographies attached to many of the entries, and considerable cross-referencing. The cross-references run from philosophic movements, to technical terms, to the positions of individual philosophers, thus encouraging a personal exploration of the themes, movements, and thinkers of any particular school of thought. The end result is a reasonably compact single volume with many of the features of a multivolume encyclopedia.Reese covers both analytic and Continental philosophy, and includes a good deal of the history of philosophy.

Translated from the Polish by award-winning translators John and Bogdana Carpenter, these sixty-eight verse and prose poems span forty years of Herbert's incredible life and work. The pieces are organized chronologically from 1950 to 1990, with an emphasis on the writer's early and late poems.</p><p>Here Zbigniew Herbert's poetry turns from the public--what we have come to expect from this poet--to the more personal. The title poem, "Elegy for the Departure of Pen Ink and Lamp , is a three-part farewell ode to the inanimate objects and memories of childhood. Herbert reflects on the relationship between the living and the dead in "What Our Dead Do," the state of his homeland in "Country," and the power of language in <em>"We fall asleep on words . . . "</em> Herbert's short prose poems read like aphorisms, deceptively whimsical but always wise: "Bears are divided into brown and white, also paws, head, and trunk. They have nice snouts, and small eyes.... Children who love Winnie-the-Pooh would give them anything, but a hunter walks in the forest and aims with his rifle between that pair of small eyes."</p><p><em>Elegy for the Departure and Other Poems</em> confirms Zbigniew Herbert's place as one of the world's greatest and most influential poets.</p></p><p>John Keats, in his "Ode on a Grecian Urn," first described scenes of sylvan revelry before proclaiming, "'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,'--that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know." In "Fragment of a Greek Vase" Zbigniew Herbert takes a different lesson from the ancient world. Describing the image of a dead Greek soldier, he writes: <blockquote> he has closed his eyes<br> renouncing the world<br> leaves droop in the silent air<br> a branch trembles touched by a shadow of flying birds<br> and only the cricket hidden<br> in Memnon's still living hair<br> proclaims a convincing<br> praise of life </blockquote> Herbert's world-view was indelibly shaped by two events: the Nazi invasion of Poland when he was 15 and the subsequent Communist takeover after the war. His poems are filled with elegiac images of a gentler past juxtaposed with the grim realities that replaced them. In "Three Poems by Heart" he writes first of "the children in our street / scourge of cats / the pigeons-- / softly gray" and then later comments, "the children on our street / had a difficult death / pigeons fell lightly / like shot down air." And in "The Ardennes Forest" even descriptions of wild strawberry leaves and ripening wild pears cannot erase the deeper associations with that place of wartime slaughter: "a charred cloud / forehead branded by black light / and a thousand lids pressed / tightly on motionless eyeballs." <p> Indeed, the dead are seldom absent from these poems. Herbert describes the objects in a still life as "violently separated from life." In the prose poem "Bears" even A.A. Milne's famous character becomes a potential victim : "Children who love Winnie-the-Pooh would give them anything, but a hunter walks in the forest and aims with his rifle between that pair of small eyes." Herbert, who died in 1998, used a wide variety of poetic forms to explore the power of memory, the betrayal of the past, and the bonds between the living and the dead. Beautifully translated by John and Bogdana Carpenter, <i>Elegy for the Departure</i> is a fitting requiem for its author. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p>Zbigniew Herbert was born in Lw�w, Poland, in 1924.

One day to go. Tomorrow she would rejoin Sigrid.</p><p>She felt tired. Not tired in the sense that she needed sleep but tired of everything. Of life. Of humanity. Of everything that had happened. She had found a k ind of peace before Holger showed her the photographs in the folder, but once he left, it had crept over her again. This vile feeling.</p><p><i>Evil.</i></p><p>She took a swig from the bottle she&#x2019;d brought with her and pulled the knitted cap further over her ears. It had grown colder now; spring had not come early after all. It had only tricked everyone into thinking it was com- ing. Mia was pleased that she had the bottle to warm her up. This wasn&#x2019;t how she&#x2019;d imagined her last day. She had actually planned to cram as much as she could into her final twenty-four hours of life. The birds, the trees, the sea, the light. Have a d ay off from self-medicating so that she could feel things, be aware of herself, one last time. It had not worked out that way. After Holger left her, her desire for sensory deprivation had only increased. She had drunk more. Taken more pills. Woken up without real- izing that she&#x2019;d been asleep. Fallen asleep without realizing she&#x2019;d been awake. She had promised herself not to care too much about the contents of the file. Stupid, obviously. When had she ever been able to distance her- self from anything in these cases? Her job. Well, it might be a job for other people, but not for Mia Kr�ger. Each case affected her far too deeply. They all reached right inside her soul, as if it were her own story, as if&nbsp;<i>she&nbsp;</i>were the victim. Kidnapped, raped, beaten with iron bars, burned with ciga- rettes, killed with a drug overdose, only six years old, hanged from a tree with a jump rope.</p><p><i>Why wasn&#x2019;t Pauline Olsen&#x2019;s name on the schoolbooks?</i></p><p><i>When everything else had been planned down to the last detail. Fuck it.</i></p><p>She&#x2019;d tried blanking out the image of the little girl hanging from the tree, but she could not get it out of her head. Everything seemed so staged. So theatrical. Almost like a game. A k ind of message. But for whom? For whoever found the child? The police? Mia had trawled through her memo- ries to discover if the name Toni had cropped up in any case she&#x2019;d been in- volved with but had found nothing. This was exactly the kind of thing she used to be so brilliant at, but she no longer seemed to be able to function. And yet there was something here, something she could not quite put her finger on, and it irritated her. Mia watched the sun sink into the sea and tried to concentrate. A message? For the police? An old case? A cold case? There were only a few unsolved cases in her career history, thank God. Even so, one or two still troubled her. A rich elderly lady had been found dead in her apartment, but they had been unable to prove that it was murder even though Mia personally was fairly sure that one of the daughters was re- sponsible for the old lady&#x2019;s death. She could not remember the name Toni in connection with that investigation. They had helped Ringerike Police in a missing-persons inquiry some years back. A b aby had disappeared from the maternity ward, and a Swedish man had claimed responsibility and killed himself, but the baby had never been found. The case was shelved, even though Mia had fought to keep it active. No Toni in that investigation either, not as far as she could remember. Pauline. Six years. Hang on, wasn&#x2019;t it six years since that baby had disappeared? Mia drained the bottle and let her eyes rest on the horizon while she tried to guide her gaze inward. Back- ward. Six years back. There was something here. She could almost taste it. But it refused to rise to the surface.</p><p><i>Damn.</i></p><p>Mia rummaged around her pants pockets for more pills but found none. She had forgotten to bring more. Her medication was laid out on the dining table now. Everything she had left. Plenty of it. Ready for use. She had imag- ined waiting until dawn, until the light came. Better to travel in the light, had been her thinking.&nbsp;<i>If I t ravel in darkness, perhaps I&#x2019;ll end up in dark- ness,&nbsp;</i>but right now she did not care. All she had to do was wait until the clock passed midnight. When April 17 became 18.</p><p><i>Come to me, Mia, come.</i></p><p>It was not the ending she had imagined. She got up and hurled the empty bottle angrily into the sea. She regretted it immediately&#x2014;she shouldn&#x2019;t litter; this rule had stayed with her since her childhood. The lovely garden. Her parents. Her grandmother. Instead she should have written a message and put it in the bottle. Done something beautiful in her last few hours on earth.</p><p><br>Helped someone in need. Solved a case. She wanted to go back to the house, but she could not get her legs to move. She stayed where she was, hugging herself, freezing, on the rocks.</p><p><i>Toni J. W. Smith. Toni J. W. Smith. Toni J. W. Smith. Toni J. W. Smith. Pau- line. No, not Pauline. Toni J. W. Smith.</i></p><p><i>Oh, hell.</i></p><p>Mia Kr�ger suddenly woke up. As did her head, her legs, her arms, her blood, her breathing, her senses.</p><p><i>Toni J. W. Smith.</i></p><p>Of course. Of course. Of course. Oh, dear Lord, why had she not seen this earlier? It was so obvious. As clear as day. Mia ran toward the house, tripped in the darkness but got back on her feet, stormed into the living room without closing the door behind her. She continued into the kitchen. She knelt down by the cupboard below the utility sink and started going through the trash can. This was where she had tossed it, wasn&#x2019;t it? The cell phone he had left or her.</p><p><i>In case you change your mind.</i></p><p>She found the phone in the garbage and rummaged around for the scrap of paper that had accompanied it. A yellow Post-it note with a PIN code and Holger&#x2019;s number. She went back to the living room, could hardly wait now, turned on the phone. Entered the code on the small screen with trembling fingers. Of course. Of course. No wonder it didn&#x2019;t add up. Everything had to add up. And it did. Toni J. W. Smith. Of course. She was an idiot.</p><p>Mia rang Holger&#x2019;s number and waited impatiently for him to pick up. The call went to voice mail, but she tried the number again. And again. And again, until she finally heard Holger&#x2019;s sleepy voice on the other end.</p><p>&#x201c;Mia?&#x201d; Holger yawned.</p><p>&#x201c;I got it,&#x201d; Mia said breathlessly.</p><p>&#x201c;What have you got? What time is it?&#x201d; &#x201c;Who cares what time it is? I&#x2019;ve got it.&#x201d; &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Toni J. W. Smith.&#x201d; &#x201c;Seriously? What is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think that J.W. is short for Joachim Wicklund. The Swedish suspect</p><p>from the H�nefoss case. Do you remember him?&#x201d; &#x201c;Of course I do,&#x201d; Munch mumbled.</p><p><br>&#x201c;As for Toni Smith,&#x201d; Roma continued, &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s an anagram:&nbsp;<i>It&#x2019;s not him.&nbsp;</i>Joachim Wicklund didn&#x2019;t do it. It&#x2019;s the same perpetrator, Holger. As in the H�nefoss case.&#x201d;</p><p>Munch was silent for a long time. Mia could practically hear the cogs turn in his brain. It was almost too far out to be true, but even so. It had to be an anagram.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; Mia said.</p><p>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s insane,&#x201d; Munch said at length. &#x201c;Worst thing is, I think you might be right. So are you coming?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Mia replied. &#x201c;But this case only. Then I quit. I have other things</p><p>to do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. It&#x2019;s up to you,&#x201d; Munch said. &#x201c;Are we back in Mariboesgate?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll catch the plane tomorrow.&#x201d; &#x201c;Great. See you there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You will.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Drive carefully, will you?&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m always careful, Holger.&#x201d; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re never careful, Mia.&#x201d; &#x201c;Screw you, Holger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I love you, too, Mia. Good to have you back. See you tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>Mia ended the call and stood for a moment smiling cautiously to her- self. Now feeling calm, she walked into the living room and looked at all the pills she had lined up on the dining table.</p><p><i>Come to me, Mia, come.</i></p><p>In her mind she apologized to her twin sister. Sigrid would have to wait a little longer. Mia Kr�ger had a job to do first.</p></p><h2>Pilates Expanded Supplemental Exercises To The Reformer, Cadillac, Wunda Chair &amp; Barrels Photo Encyclopedia</h2><p>This Pilates Expanded manual is designed for Pilates instructors and experienced Pilates enthusiasts who wish to expand their repertoire of Pilates inspired exercises and variations.

This compact tour de force affirms Dionne Brand's place as one of Canada's most dazzling and influential artists. </b></b><br><br><i>Theory</i> begins as its narrator sets out, like many a graduate student, to write a wildly ambitious thesis on the past, present, and future of art, culture, race, gender, class, and politics--a revolutionary work that its author believes will synthesize and thereby transform the world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our narrator tries to complete this magnum opus, three lovers enter the story, one after the other, each transforming the endeavour: first, there is beautiful and sensual Selah, who scoffs at the narrator's constant tinkering with academic abstractions; then altruistic and passionate Yara, who rescues every lost soul who crosses her path; and finally, spiritual occultist Odalys, who values magic and superstition over the heady intellectual and cultural circles the narrator aspires to inhabit. Each galvanizing love affair (representing, in turn, the heart, the head and the spirit) upends and reorients the narrator's life and, inevitably, requires an overhaul of the ever larger and more unwieldy dissertation, with results both humorous and poignant.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By effortlessly telling this short, intense tale in the voice of an unnamed, ungendered (and brilliantly unreliable) narrator, Dionne Brand makes a bold statement not only about love and personhood, but about race and gender--and what can and cannot be articulated in prose when the forces that inhabit the space between words are greater than words themselves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gorgeous, profoundly moving, word- and note-perfect novel of ideas that only a great artist at the height of her powers could write.</p><p>DIONNE BRAND's literary credentials are legion. Her most recent book of poetry, <i>Ossuaries,</i> won the Griffin Poetry Prize; her nine others include winners of the Governor General's Literary Award, the Trillium Book Award and the Pat Lowther Memorial Award. Her novel <i>In Another Place, Not Here</i> was selected as a <i>NYT Book Review </i>Notable Book and a Best Book by the <i>Globe and Mail</i>; <i>At the Full and Change of the Moon</i> was selected a Best Book by the <i>LA Times</i> and <i>What We All Long For</i> won the Toronto Book Award. In 2006, Brand was awarded the Harbourfront Festival Prize for her contribution to the world of books and writing, and was Toronto's Poet Laureate from 2009 to 2012. In 2017, she was named to the Order of Canada. Brand is a Professor in the School of English and Theatre Studies at the University of Guelph. She lives in Toronto.<b>Selah</b><br> &nbsp;<br> In retrospect, I loved Selah for reasons anyone can understand. First, she loved herself more than she loved me. And this led me to think that I would get some respite from the world, and at the same time receive the little affections I required to complete my life&#x2019;s work: my dissertation.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wanted Selah to spare me only a few glances and gestures while she took care of her most singular concern&#x2014;her body. I imagined her thoughts passing over me briefly while she did her eyes or painted her nails red. I believed this oblique affection, like the affection one has for landscapes or animals, would be sufficient for my needs.<br> &nbsp;<br> I don&#x2019;t require much in the way of attention, you see. All my life I&#x2019;ve sat at an angle, observing the back and forth of other people&#x2019;s lives. Even as a child I found myself on the diagonal to events in the living room and the kitchen. I used to sit crouched with my arms around my knees, trying to watch and listen and not be noticed. I used to summon all my stillness to do this because if I were observed, all events would cease and I would become the object of commands to do some job like cleaning a shoe or finding a book to read. Or worse, I would be upbraided for listening in on conversations beyond my years, which it seemed was a sign of immorality. My childhood was spent inhabiting this angle nevertheless, at the risk of beatings and other sanctions. I enjoyed this vantage point because it provided me with a view of the tumult of people&#x2019;s lives without the involvement. And so I perfected this geometry, I excelled at finding just the right distance from actions and conversations. From there, I learned a great deal about human beings, first at home and then in the world where, I discovered, it was much easier to conceal oneself. <br><br> Anyone would be forgiven, I think, for loving Selah. After all, in this world there is a shared aesthetic, however oppressive, however repetitive, of loving a certain manifestation of a woman, and Selah inhab�ited that manifestation. One finds oneself compelled to take part in the aesthetic, no matter the tedium of its repetitions. It is so anaesthetic&#x2014;well, actually, it is like a hammer and a crowbar, opening your skull and your heart. You can see its manifestation all over the world on billboards&#x2014;interpretations of a certain symmetry, or to be exact, an asymmetry. Although Selah, I must admit, was not an interpretation; she was the object, the object of interpretation. She was voluptuous, truly. That word&#x2014;Selah was its owner. A smooth, sumptuous human being. Even-fleshed, tall, athletic, bracing, supple. Her skin, a burnt almond, yet smelled of cinnamon. I do not mean here to invoke the Brazilian writer Jorge Amado&#x2019;s Gabriela, Clove, et cetera. And I don&#x2019;t mean to dissociate Selah, the body, from Selah, the intelligence, in the way that most people do. We are mainly body after all, and the body is intelligence. We turn it into this petty panto�mime of gender, so its beauty is lost on us. I try every day to break out of the pantomime. Nevertheless, I spent hours smelling Selah&#x2019;s right shoulder. Her skin is so smooth there. She didn&#x2019;t appreciate my dog&#x2019;s nose sniffing her, but the cinnamon is most noticeable there, warmed in the bowl of her clavicle. I asked Selah if she rubbed herself in cinnamon. Did she roll around in cinnamon powder each morning, or did she walk through burning branches of cinna�mon trees at night? She looked disgusted with me. Of course not, she said. <br><br> Back to the body as intelligence: the body is, after all, a living organism&#x2014;with its own intention, sepa�rate from the parsed out, pored over intentions that one can say come from the mind. The mind&#x2019;s inter�pretation of the body is irrelevant. The body pursues its own needs and its own desires with fibre optic precision not even yet detailed by scientists. Selah&#x2019;s body, for example, has decided on cinnamon and it has, to my way of thinking, synthesized all of the atmosphere around it to the smell of cinnamon. Or let me withdraw that previous statement. Perhaps it is my body, my olfactory nerve, that decided on cin�namon at the appearance of Selah, and so it collected the smell of cinnamon around the presence of Selah. On the other hand, there might be a third theory unknown to both Selah and me that accounts for the cinnamon. Whatever the truth of this, Selah smelled of cinnamon. <br><br> Let me say at the beginning that I do not know anything about Selah. I do not know where she was born, I do not know about her upbringing or her schooling. Nor do I know any detail about her father or mother. Selah kept all this a secret from me&#x2014;or not so much a secret as she thought it was none of my affair. I would pry and poke around, asking her about her life before me&#x2014;to which she would give elliptical answers, not filling in the true details. When I inquired further, in that way I have of forecasting that I am trying to dig out a secret, Selah immediately grew suspicious and stared at me like a star from a distant constellation. It was as if she already saw my plan for superficial analysis and found it boring. Selah also did not care that I analyzed her silence in this same pathetic way. At least, she said, there was nothing in the silence except my imagination, so I could specu�late all I wanted. <br><br> Back again to the idea of the body itself as intelli�gence: when I made love to Selah&#x2014;for that is what she said I did&#x2014;Selah&#x2019;s body was discerning in every (for want of a better word) touch. In those moments she could tell if I was sincere or not in my life and in my intentions. In those moments life is truthful, it has a core, an honesty; it is a plain act and there is no deception. The body then is like a surveillance machine with nerve endings and light scanners, sound detectors and particle analysis. Whatever is transmitted cannot be reinterpreted or taken back. Selah pointed out to me that it was on her body that these acts took place, not on mine. That is, I made love to her, she did not make love to me. This euphemism, make love, is not how she put it. She said, &#x201c;It is my body that is at work.&#x201d; This statement was at once stunning for its clarity; somewhat embarrassing for me, as it pointed out an unobserved tendency on my part; and truthful. My embarrassment at these words is still present even a decade later. Selah&#x2019;s body was the body at work. I preyed upon Selah&#x2019;s body. Her body was the central terrain and I, like some bird with taloned feet and beak, attacked her flesh and bones. Or I was like a forensic scientist, but a scientist of love, or an undertaker or a surgeon of love&#x2014;whatever I may call it, I was dissecting her muscle from her blood vessels in my experiment of love. <br><br> I thought Selah liked my lovemaking, my atten�tions to the most minute areas of her skin. It had seemed this way to me until her declaration. I said as much to Selah, in an unavoidably wounded tone. I did not catch myself before that tone emerged and so I foreclosed whatever else Selah had to say. I regret this, but her declaration had confirmed a doubt I always had, namely, What did Selah see in me? Why had she acquiesced to being with me at all? Still to this day I cannot fathom why Selah took me on as a lover. <br><br> I am not avoiding the question of why Selah rarely made love to me, but there is so much more to say about her and about our life together that it would be unworthy to dwell on that or to suggest that it was in any way pivotal to the outcome. Selah always told the truth. That is certain. I, however, never truly listened to her until I was faced with my self-delusion. And meanwhile, I always lied to Selah. I thought I was saving her from the harshness of situations. She, to her credit, never believed me. She went on in her own reality. Selah was much better at being in the world than I was. She knew and assumed the conventions of normalcy that I only paid lip service to, which brings me once again to the question of why I was in love with Selah. I cannot confirm that Selah was in love with me; I could never tell. Sometimes she dis�played a great warmth for me. She would leave off her preening and embrace me, especially when I brought her a gift of some kind, or when I suggested, desper�ately, we go on a trip to a warm place. <br><br> Once we went to Seville in August. Selah fought me the whole month, but she also picked figs in the mornings and walked through the Sierpes in the late afternoons looking gorgeous. In Seville, we house-sat for a professor of mine, a professor of philology with whom I had taken a graduate course and had become quite close. Selah and I would emerge each day from our house-sit at the wrong hour&#x2014;the hour when the sun was strongest and all of Seville was asleep. We drifted through the orange-hot streets trying to find a caf�, the sun baked us, we felt glorious and invin�cible. Then, finding a shaded resto, we would eat pes�cado a la plancha and I would drink a beer while Selah examined her skin. I would try to engage Selah in some talk about Spanish colonialism, or the obvi�ous Arab qualities of Seville, and she would barely respond, as if to say, What does that have to do with my holiday? Selah, of course, was right: it had noth�ing to do with it. My overbearing teaching often leeched the pleasures of the moment. Selah merely wanted to &#x201c;be.&#x201d; And how could I blame her? I wanted to &#x201c;be&#x201d; also.<br><br> Selah had a beauty that was unanswerable, unlearnable. After all, what is the response to beauty? I had nothing to offer in response to this beauty. How do you answer the smell of cinnamon? How can smoothness have a reply? What do you do when you glimpse Selah in a far-off store window crossing a cobbled square with a gnome beside her? You see Selah, she is wearing black, she has dark glasses, she is carrying a bag, she is like a sharp dagger or a bolt of lightning striking the air and you are struck in the forehead, you lose sight in one eye. And then you observe the gnome beside her, the gnome who is you, and the gnome is arguing with Selah. &#x201c;One month,&#x201d; the gnome is saying, and the sight makes you shut up. But the gnome goes on nevertheless, &#x201c;One month, you cannot give me one month of peace!&#x201d; The gnome is haranguing Selah and Selah is indifferent, so the gnome shuts up and creeps along beside Selah. Why is Selah walking with that gnome, you remark out loud to no one. Our days in Seville invariably con�tained a moment like this. Selah had the dissatisfac�tion of beauty, because of course beauty can never be satisfied and can never be satisfactory to the beauti�ful. The imperfect is always more rewarding, more active, since it is striving for perfection. So Selah always seemed dissatisfied to me. Though I could be wrong and perhaps it is my probing personality that casts a doubt on beauty. Yes, my own dissatisfaction infected Selah&#x2019;s contentment. <br><br> Selah <i>was </i>content, I realize now. I came home sometimes to find her singing along with the radio, the sound of some inane popular song booming against the walls. Ashanti, Mary J. Blige and Nelly. Selah would be cooking one of her specialities&#x2014;the pots bubbling on the stove, the smell of smoked corn, fried grouper, all the aromas I loved&#x2014;yet I could not help myself, the stupid songs dominated my atten�tion. They annoyed me immediately and I could not resist asking Selah how old she was, and when would she let go of that teenage stuff? Clearly I loved Selah much more than I loved her ways. Though, to take that back, I loved Selah&#x2019;s ways, despite my objections to them. I loved how Selah remained attentive to pop�ular things while I made up theories for them. Selah ignored me. She said how old-fashioned I was, how out of time, how queer. She was right. I know I am out of time. Everything about our different tastes made me question why we were together, but I still ignored this question.</p><h2>The Seer: Volume I of The O Manuscript: The Scandinavian Bestseller</h2><p>&#x2018;<i>Everything mankind longs for is, and has always been, within his reach.

She lives in Rock Island, Illinois.Chapter One <br><br>Gabrielle Cheney peered through the slits of her mask, picking her way carefully along the path overgrown with weeds. The courtyard of the Maison d&#x2019; Esprit was silent as a ceme- tery and twice as eerie. The moon cast a pale light over moss- blackened fountains and broken statuary. Some headless saint presided over the withered remains of a rose garden. The flowers were long gone, but the thorns were not, one branch catching at the hem of Gabrielle&#x2019;s cloak.<br><br>As she bent to free herself, she was beset by the troubling sensation that had afflicted her all evening. The feeling that she was being followed. Straightening, she curled her fingers over the hilt of the sword hidden beneath her cloak and whirled around. The iron gate and stone wall were nothing more than vague outlines in the fog-bound night. But as she stared, another figure took shape, that of a tall proud warrior.<br><br>Her hand fell away from the sword and she uttered a soft choked cry. Not of fear, but more of despair because she had seen the silhouette of this man far too many times in her dreams. She took a step forward only to check the motion, knowing it would do her no good. There would be no smile to greet her, no strong arms to welcome her because he didn&#x2019;t exist, this phantom man. All she would find was empty space and silence.<br><br>Ghosts left no footfalls and memories cast no shadows, except perhaps on the human heart. She watched the figure of the man evaporate into the mist as he always did. Gabrielle had never once seen his face, but she knew beyond certainty who he was.<br><br>Nicolas Remy, the captain from Navarre. Whether it was his ghost she kept seeing or only a figment of her own tormented imagination, the effect was always the same. Gabrielle&#x2019;s heart constricted with sorrow and guilt.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Remy,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve asked your forgiveness a thousand times. What more do you want from me? Why can&#x2019;t you leave me in peace?&#x201d;<br><br>She knew she would never gain any answer to that question, at least not in this damp, misty courtyard. With one last glance behind her, Gabrielle turned and hastened toward the house.<br><br>The stone manor loomed ahead of her, splintered wood and a great hole where the front door should be, gaping like the jagged mouth of some fierce beast ready to devour her. But Gabrielle feared the ghosts of her own memories far more than she did the sinister aspect of the house. Besides she knew the truth behind the legends of the Maison d&#x2019;Esprit far better than the superstitious Parisians who blessed themselves every time they had to pass those rusting gates.<br><br>Easing past the shattered remains of the door, she entered the house, the darkness swallowing her. The boarded-up windows blocked out what pale moonlight there was to be had. Gabrielle stripped off her mask and reached beneath her cloak for the large pouch fastened to her belt. She groped until she found the candle set in its small brass holder, along with the tinderbox she had brought. After much fumbling between flint and wick, she managed to coax the taper to light.<br><br>The tiny flame spluttered to life, casting a small circle of illumination. Gabrielle moved deeper into the room that yawned before her, the grit crunching beneath her feet. Holding up the candle, she surveyed the wreckage of the once-magnificent great hall. The bishop had done very handsomely by his mistress until the witch-hunters had come.<br><br>A beautiful high table of carved oak had been pulled from the dais and overturned, the broken remains of chairs and stools littered nearby. Tapestries had been dragged from the walls and sliced to ribbons, the musty scent of rotting wool heavy in the air. Even the iron candelabrum had been wrenched from the ceiling and left with its chain snaking around it. Everything was coated with thick cobwebs as though time had sought to weave a shroud for this house.<br><br>The witch-hunters had done their work well. Gabrielle shivered with a mingling of horror and pity, remembering the night those fiends had invaded her own home on Faire Isle. She and her sisters, Ariane and Miri, had only been saved by the intervention of the Comte de Renard, the man who eventually became Ariane&#x2019;s husband.<br><br>But no such rescue had come to poor Giselle Lascelles and her daughters. How terrified those women must have been, dragged from their home, crying and shrieking to meet the worst sort of torture and death that could befall any daughter of the earth. All of them lost, save one . . .<br><br>The appearance of the great hall was calculated to make any chance intruder believe that the Maison d&#x2019;Esprit was uninhabited by anyone but ghosts. Gabrielle was one of the few who knew better. Lifting her skirts, she moved to the stairs stretching upward. The small glow of her candle could not reach far enough to penetrate the upper regions of the landing, to detect whoever or whatever might be lurking there.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; she called tentatively.<br><br>Her voice echoed, swallowed up by the vast silence of the house. &#x201c;Cassandra Lascelles?&#x201d; Gabrielle called more loudly.<br><br>She was met with more unnerving silence, then she thought she heard a floorboard creak. Gabrielle moistened her lips and tried again. &#x201c;Cass? Are you there? It is me . . . Gabrielle Cheney. I need to talk to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>She checked abruptly at a low rumbling sound. Staring up at the landing, she caught the shadow of movement. Her heart leapt into her throat as two baleful yellow eyes glared back at her, the rumbling escalating into a fearsome growl. The creature sprang forward, a large brownish-black mastiff with a heavy muscular body.<br><br>&#x201c;Merde!&#x201d; Gabrielle cried.<br><br>As it bounded down the stairs, Gabrielle scrambled back, nearly dropping her candle. Hot wax splashed over the brass holder, searing her hand. She winced with pain, but managed to keep a grip on the taper.<br><br>Retreating across the room, she stumbled up against an aumbry, the wooden shelves gouging against her spine. Her pursuer skidded to a halt a few feet away, cornering her against the cupboard. Baring cruel-looking incisors, it snarled.<br><br>&#x201c;C-Cerberus. Good d-dog,&#x201d; Gabrielle quavered. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you remember me?&#x201d;<br><br>Apparently he did not. The mastiff issued a series of savage barks. Her younger sister could have crooned a few words to the dog, soothing him at once. But Gabrielle had never possessed Miri&#x2019;s strange affinity with all four-legged creatures.<br><br>Fortunately, Gabrielle had long ago learned the weakness of this particular beast. One wary eye on the dog, she inched aside enough to set her candle down on the aumbry shelf. She groped for the pouch hidden beneath her cloak. The cursed drawstrings refused to budge or perhaps her fingers were too clumsy with nervousness. Somehow she got the purse open, and drew forth a cluster of slightly squashed red grapes.<br><br>Swallowing her fear, she croaked, &#x201c;Nice Cerberus. S-sweet beastie. Look what I have for you.&#x201d;<br><br>She carefully extended her arm, the handful of red grapes glistening against her palm. The dog gave a sharp bark. Gabrielle jumped and tossed the grapes wildly. The cluster hit the floor with a dull thud, causing the dog to shy back.<br><br>Cerberus crept forward again, snuffling her offering. The dog emitted a delighted whine and began greedily gulping down the fruit. Gabrielle ventured a few steps away from the wall. Cerberus would make no objection to her movement, at least until the grapes ran out.<br><br>&#x201c;What have you done to my dog?&#x201d; An imperious voice rang out.<br><br>Gabrielle twisted toward the sound and breathed a sigh of relief as the mastiff&#x2019;s owner finally put in an appearance. Cassandra Lascelles stood poised at the top of the stairs, a tall, thin silhouette. How long she had been there, Gabrielle had no idea. She seemed to have materialized out of nowhere.<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t done anything to your precious Cerberus,&#x201d; Gabrielle retorted. &#x201c;Merely bribed him with a few grapes to keep him from devouring me instead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gabrielle? Is that you?&#x201d; Cass asked sharply.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>Clutching the banister, Cass began to descend the stairs with elaborate care. She had been blind almost from the moment of her birth. A young woman, she was not much older than Gabrielle&#x2019;s own twenty-one years, although there was a hard, brittle quality about Cass that often made her seem much older.<br><br>A tattered red gown half-hung off her thin frame, baring one shoulder. The weight of her mass of gypsy-dark hair appeared too heavy for her slender neck. She had an exotic face with high slanting cheekbones and an ice-white complexion that seldom saw the light of the sun. Her sightless dark eyes were fixed and without expression, all emotion centered in her mouth, which at the moment was slashed thin with displeasure.<br><br>For one deprived of her vision, she moved with a remarkable amount of grace and stealth. It was only when she cleared the last step and let go of the banister that she faltered, stretching out one hand cautiously into the vast empty space of the room.<br><br>&#x201c;Cerberus! Come,&#x201d; she commanded.<br><br>The dog&#x2019;s ears pricked up, but he hesitated, still searching for more grapes.<br><br>&#x201c;Cerberus! Come here!&#x201d;<br><br>The formidable beast whined and lowered his head, slinking guiltily over to his mistress. Cassandra groped until she seized hold of the dog&#x2019;s leather collar.<br><br>&#x201c;Bad dog. Heel!&#x201d;<br><br>Cerberus sank even lower. As the chastened dog positioned itself beside her, Cass grumbled, &#x201c;Blasted fool. Just like any other male. Ruled by your stomach.&#x201d;<br><br>She softened her scolding by scratching him behind the ears. The ferocious-looking beast transformed, his eyes going limpid, his tail wagging, his massive body quivering with adoration.<br><br>It was the mistress who now seemed the more formidable of the two. One hand resting protectively on her dog&#x2019;s head, Cass straightened and scowled.<br><br>&#x201c;Damnation, Gabrielle Cheney. I have warned you before not to come here without first sending word through my servant. I do not like to be taken unawares. Bribe or no bribe, you are lucky Cerberus did not tear out your throat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am sorry,&#x201d; Gabrielle said, taking a cautious step closer. &#x201c;But I was desperate to see you and I didn&#x2019;t have time to contact you through Finette. I have been here enough times before that I thought Cerberus might recognize me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He is trained not to recognize anyone. Otherwise he would not be much of a protector.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But surely you do not need such protection from another daughter of the earth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not all daughters of the earth are to be trusted. You above anyone should know that.&#x201d; Cass gave a scornful sniff. &#x201c;And I hate such mincing terms as &#x2018;wise women&#x2019; and daughters of the earth. Let us just say witches and be done with it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but let us not say it too loudly.&#x201d; Gabrielle replied wryly.<br><br>Cass&#x2019;s rigid features melted into a reluctant smile. She bent and muttered some low command to her dog. With her hand still poised on Cerberus&#x2019;s collar, she walked forward with a sure step that Gabrielle always found astonishing.<br><br>Gabrielle had seen her sister Miri accomplish some astounding feats with animals, but the degree of rapport between Cassandra and her dog, the way she had taught Cerberus to be her eyes, was nothing short of magic.<br><br>Cerberus led Cass straight over to Gabrielle. Another low command and the dog took up position, sitting beside her, eyes trained on Cass as though waiting her next order. Cass reached out boldly until she made contact with Gabrielle. Drawing her forward, she enveloped Gabrielle in a brisk hug.<br><br>&#x201c;I did not mean to make you feel unwelcome, my friend,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;But next time, let me know when you are coming.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will,&#x201d; Gabrielle promised. As she hugged her in turn, Gabrielle was uncomfortably aware of the thinness of Cass&#x2019;s frame beneath her worn gown. She wished that she could persuade Cass to give over living like a recluse in this depressing abandoned house. Or at least allow Gabrielle to provide her with a few comforts like better food and clothing. But Gabrielle was all too familiar with Cass&#x2019;s fierce pride and sense of independence.<br><br>Cass released her and stepped back, her lips quirking upward in a faintly teasing smile. &#x201c;Well, to what do I owe the honor of this unexpected visit? Surely you cannot have already used up that last bottle of perfume I brewed for you. I gave you enough to bring every man at court to his knees.&#x201d;</p><h2>Wedding Peach, Vol. 6</h2><p>Finding out that her boyfriend is a demon who has sworn to kill Wedding Peach and her Angels, Momoko travels to the demon world for one final battle.</p><p></p><h2>Rocky Road</h2><p>Evil agency SHADOW is really rocking the SHINE network.

A loving marriage, the raising of four children, and a devotion to social and cultural causes marked her early years as queen, although there were already signs of grave national diversions on the horizon.</p><p>Twenty years later the dream had turned into a nightmare: demonstrations and riots shook the country, and Farah and the Shah decided to leave in order to avoid bloodshed. With the hardcover publication of <em>An Enduring Love</em>, a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller (extended list) in 2004, Farah Diba, wife of the last emperor of Iran, broke her silence and told the wrenching story of her love for a man and his country. Her compelling memoir offers an intimate view of a time of upheaval, but stands above all as a powerful human document from one whose life was caught up in an epic and tragic national struggle.</p></p><p>Her Majesty Queen <b>Farah Pahlavi</b> divides her time between Paris, France and Washington, D.C.The memoir of Farah (Diba) Pahlavi, widow of the Shah of Iran, seems, at first glance, like a clone of Noor's bestselling Leap of Faith. Both queens were intelligent young women when they met and married their older kings; both remain discreet about their intimate lives with their husbands (who both loved piloting planes and playing with their children); both immersed themselves, as new queens, in cultural programs and social betterment work for their people; and both end their memoirs shortly after the deaths of their husbands. The parallels are almost uncanny - at least until midway through Pahlavi's story, when the real differences emerge. In 1963, the Shah began his "white revolution" to modernize Iran by instituting land reform, women's rights and workers' rights; Communists and fundamentalist clerics vehemently opposed these changes. In Pahlavi's eyes, the monarchy stood for liberalization, even if its enforcement agencies were condemned worldwide for human rights abuses. To her, criticism of the monarchy only supported Khomeini's Islamic fundamentalist opposition. As the insurgency gained strength and the royal family weighed exit strategies, Pahlavi shouldered a new, personal burden: the Shah's concealed battle with cancer. Asylum offers were few. Sadat welcomed them to Egypt, but their stays in the Bahamas, Mexico, the United States and Panama were politically difficult. The Shah's medical treatments, meanwhile, were so bungled, so shaded by political maneuvering, that Pahlavi resorts to quoting extensively from one doctor's records. She ends her account with the Shah's death in 1980, their youngest daughter's death and the Iran-Iraq War, while Pahlavi's life has continued in Paris and Washington, DC. Readers seeking a female perspective on Iran's turbulent recent history will enjoy this candid, straightforward account.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Inspector Kurt Wallander and his team receive an anonymous tip-off. A few days later a life raft is washed up on a beach. In it are two men, dressed in expensive suits, shot dead. The dead men were criminals, victims of what seems to have been a gangland hit. But what appears to be an open-and-shut case soon takes on a far more sinister aspect. Wallander travels across the Baltic Sea, to Riga in Latvia, where he is plunged into a frozen, alien world of police surveillance, scarcely veiled threats, and lies. Doomed always to be one step behind the shadowy figures he pursues, only Wallander&#39;s obstinate desire to see that justice is done brings the truth to light.</p><p>Second in the Kurt Wallander series.<br><br>On the Swedish coastline, two bodies, victims of grisly torture and cold execution, are discovered in a life raft. With no witnesses, no motives, and no crime scene, Detective Kurt Wallander is frustrated and uncertain he has the ability to solve a case as mysterious as it is heinous. But after the victims are traced to the Baltic state of Latvia, a country gripped by the upheaval of Soviet disintegration, Major Liepa of the Riga police takes over the investigation. Thinking his work done, Wallander slips into routine once more, until suddenly, he is called to Riga and plunged into an alien world where shadows are everywhere, everything is watched, and old regimes will do anything to stay alive.Henning Mankell (1948-2015) became a worldwide phenomenon with his crime writing, gripping thrillers and atmospheric novels set in Africa. His prizewinning and critically acclaimed Inspector Wallander Mysteries continue to dominate bestseller lists all over the globe and his books have been translated into forty-five languages and made into numerous international film and television adaptations: most recently the BAFTA-award-winning BBC television series Wallander, starring Kenneth Branagh. Driven by a desire to change the world and to fight against racism and nationalism, Mankell devoted much of his time to working with charities in Africa, including SOS Children&#39;s Villages and PLAN International, where he was also director of the Teatro Avenida in Maputo. In 2008, the University of St Andrews conferred Henning Mankell with an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters in recognition of his major contribution to literature and to the practical exercise of conscience. www.henningmankell.com</p><h2>New Providence: A Changing Cityscape</h2><p>Text and illustrations trace the evolution of an imaginary but typical American city from the turn of the century to the 1980&#39;s.</p><p>Grade 4 Up A thoughtful and imaginative visualization of the 80-year (1910 to present) evolution of a composite small American city center (around the square in front of the town hall). Using structures discovered in photographs of such disparate places as Cambridge, Mass.; Fresno, Calif.; Salem, Ohio; and Winooski, Vt., the authors have created New Providence and let readers see it through their perceptive eyes. Using key dates (1910, 1935, 1955, 1970, 1980, and 1987), they show how economic conditions, fads, and technological adaptations change the look and life patterns of this typical town. All details (vehicles, clothes, trees, suburbs, billboards, etc.) are accounted for and help make readers more fully understand the changes in the buildings and streets. Seasonal changes also add visual texture to the double-page long verticals that alternate with two pages of very simple text which call children's attention to some special features in the panoramas and more generally explain what forces helped create change. Each cityscape view is crammed with information (just following the changing store signs can take many minutes of flipping back and forth). By studying these pictures, readers will be able to experience the evolution from and return to a coherent visual environment that respects the stylish craftsmanship of its 19th-Century origins.

But the mayor believes in the power of democracy and rallies his fellow citizens to the polls for the presidential election, only to find hundreds of them turned away for trumped-up reasons. Even sweet old Miss Jackson&#x2014;not to mention the mayor himself&#x2014;is denied the vote because her name turns up on a bogus list of felons. The national election hinges on Illinois&#x2019;s electoral votes and, as a result of the mass disenfranchisement of East St. Louis, a radical right-wing junta led by a dim-witted Texas governor seizes the Oval Office. <br><br>Prodded by shady black billionaire and old friend John Roberts, Fredericks devises a radical plan of protest: East St. Louis will secede from the Union. Roberts opens an &#x201c;offshore&#x201d; bank (albeit in the heart of the U.S.) to finance the newly liberated country, and suddenly East St. Louis becomes the Switzerland of the American heartland, flush with money. It also begins to attract a motley circus of idealistic young militants, OPEC-funded hitmen, CIA operatives, tabloid reporters, and AWOL black servicemen eager to protect and serve the new nation. <br><br>Problems set in almost immediately: Controversies rage over the name and national anthem of the new country (they decide on the Republic of Blackland with an anthem sung to the tune of the theme from Good Times), and local thug Roscoe becomes a warlord and turns his gang into a paramilitary force. When the U.S. military begins to move in, Fredericks is forced to decide whether his protest is worth taking all the way. <br><br>Birth of a Nation starts with a scenario drawn from the botched election of 2000 and spins it into a brilliantly absurd work of sharply pointed satire. Along the way the authors lay into a host of hot social and cultural issues&#x2014;skewering white supremacists, black nationalists, and everyone in between&#x2014;drawing real blood and real laughs in equal measure in this riotous send-up of American politics.</p><p>AARON McGRUDER is the creator of The Boondocks comic strip and the author of the national bestseller <b>A Right to Be Hostile</b>. <br><br>REGINALD HUDLIN has written, produced, or directed eight films, including House Party, Boomerang, and Bebe&#x2019;s Kids. <br><br>KYLE BAKER is the author of several classic graphic novels, and his illustrations have appeared in publications nationwide.&#x201c;A memorably funny satire. . . .

Don&#x2019;t get me wrong&#x2014;it&#x2019;s still a beautiful place, but you have to work a little harder to see the beauty. Except for the dark green pines, the trees are naked and barren. It&#x2019;s overcast more often than not, a sullen gray sky reflected in the gray waters of the Kalamazoo River.</p><p>Still, it makes you appreciate the subtler charms that it&#x2019;s easy to overlook on a bright summer day: the tawny expanses of marsh grass waving gracefully along the shallow verges of the river, the elegant yellow-gold traceries of willow branches draping toward the water.</p><p>And of course the dunes, the vast sand dunes, rendered more majestic without the foliage of cottonwood, oak, and birch trees that disguises their scope in the growing season. Those dunes are what make a little town in southwest Michigan such a popular tourist destination. Well, the dunes, the white-sand beaches on the shores of Lake Michigan, and the eldritch community&#x2014;and, last month, the hauntings.</p><p>I was glad <i>that</i> was over. It had been a close call, but the gateway between the dead and the living was closed. The annual Halloween parade had been a debacle, but it hadn&#x2019;t turned into a cataclysmic bloodbath.

Technically, I&#x2019;m a part-time file clerk, but the chief calls me in to consult anytime there&#x2019;s eldritch involvement in a case.</p><p>That&#x2019;s me: Daisy Johanssen, girl detective.</p><p>Well, except that at twenty-four, I can&#x2019;t really call myself a girl.

Well, obvious to anyone who was, at least. I consider myself a local, and no local would risk fooling around with a Ouija board. When you&#x2019;re sitting on top of a functioning underworld, there&#x2019;s just no telling what could happen.</p><p>The problem is that the Pemkowet Visitors Bureau promotes paranormal tourism while downplaying the possible risks, and as a result, we get tourists who are unaware of the very real dangers they might face&#x2014;like the spectators at the Halloween parade last month, who weren&#x2019;t expecting to encounter the reanimated corpse of an infamous axe murderer.</p><p>Or like my mom, who was vacationing here on spring break with some college girlfriends.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re wondering what sort of special powers my demonic heritage gives me, the answer is pretty much none, which is because I refuse to claim my birthright.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a good reason for it.

And a breach of the Inviolate Wall could ultimately unleash Armageddon.</p><p>At least that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve always been told. It&#x2019;s conventional wisdom around these parts.</p><p>Oh, and two weeks ago, one of the Norns laid some major soothsaying on me and informed me that someday the fate of the world might hinge on the choices I make.</p><p>No pressure, right?</p><p>When I asked her for advice, she told me to trust my heart. The problem with that&#x2014;I mean, aside from the fact that it sounds like a line of dialogue from a Lifetime movie&#x2014;was that my heart was in a serious state of confusion, which is why I&#x2019;d been spending an inordinate amount of time that November mooning over the subtle glimpses of beauty to be found in the bleak, dun-colored landscape instead of confronting actual issues. And if one of the issues hadn&#x2019;t decided to man up and acknowledge the fact that we had things to discuss, I&#x2019;d probably still be mooning.</p><p><i>Mooning</i>, by the way, is a particularly apt term when there&#x2019;s a werewolf involved.</p><p>I&#x2019;d be lying if I didn&#x2019;t admit that my heart leaped when my phone rang and Cody Fairfax&#x2019;s name popped up on the screen. I hadn&#x2019;t seen him since Halloween night, and I was pretty sure he&#x2019;d been avoiding me on purpose, not entirely without reason.</p><p>I let the phone ring a few times before I answered. &#x201c;Hey.&#x201d; I kept my tone casual in case Cody was calling on a police matter. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m off duty today.

It had been well over a month since we&#x2019;d had what I&#x2019;d categorize as earth-shattering sex. I hadn&#x2019;t made a secret of the fact that I&#x2019;d had a crush on Cody since we were kids riding the school bus together. Cody hadn&#x2019;t made a secret of the fact that there was no possibility of a real relationship between us because I was an unsuitable mate for a werewolf. Kind of ironic, since he was in the eldritch closet, so to speak, but there you have it.</p><p>My temper stirred and my tail twitched. Um, yeah. I don&#x2019;t have any demonic powers, but I do have super-size emotions that occasionally cause bad things to happen, especially when I lose my temper&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I have a tail, of a more modest size. &#x201c;Are we really going to have this conversation on the <i>phone</i>, Cody?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; he said hastily. &#x201c;I just wanted to see if you were free.

I&#x2019;ll come over.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you in ten.&#x201d; He hung up.</p><p>I spent the next ten minutes tidying my apartment and, okay, checking my makeup. For the record, I mostly resemble my mom: fair skin, white-blond Scandinavian hair, a pert nose. The only trait I inherited from dear old Dad&#x2019;s side of the family&#x2014;well, aside from the tail&#x2014;is jet-black eyes, the kind you don&#x2019;t find in ordinary mortal humans.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I heard Cody&#x2019;s footsteps on the stairs leading to my apartment, which was located above Mrs. Browne&#x2019;s Olde World Bakery.</p><p>&#x201c;I brought cinnamon rolls,&#x201d; he offered, holding out a bag when I opened the door. Mrs. Browne&#x2019;s cinnamon rolls were legendary. All her baked goods were. No one, human or eldritch, can bake a better brownie.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; I took the bag. &#x201c;Come on in.&#x201d;</p><p>I put the cinnamon rolls on a plate while Cody hovered in the living room of my apartment, which seemed smaller with him in it.</p><p>&#x201c;Have a seat.&#x201d; I set the plate with the cinnamon rolls on the coffee table in front of my futon couch.</p><p>&#x201c;Daise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Cody stayed on his feet. His hands opened and closed in a gesture of frustration. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. This is awkward.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; I blew out a breath. &#x201c;Sit. Let&#x2019;s talk.&#x201d;</p><p>He sat on the futon, and I took a seat on the adjacent armchair. The cinnamon rolls sat untouched. Mogwai, the big calico tomcat who had more or less adopted me, peered warily around the door to my bedroom.</p><p>&#x201c;How have you been?&#x201d; Cody asked. &#x201c;Since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d; He let the sentence die.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>See, here&#x2019;s the thing. I&#x2019;ll spare the details, but the gist of the matter is that if Cody and I hadn&#x2019;t hooked up that first time&#x2014;which was, by the way, completely spontaneous and unexpected&#x2014;it&#x2019;s possible that we would have found the Tall Man&#x2019;s stolen remains; or at least Cody, with his werewolf-keen olfactory sense, would have. There&#x2019;s absolutely, positively no way we could have known it at the time, but the fact is that while we were lolling in the afterglow of earth-shattering sex, a thunderstorm washed away a scent trail we would have stumbled across in the course of duty, which would have meant no Halloween debacle, no axe-wielding zombie skeleton. All in all, a much better outcome.</p><p>I know Cody didn&#x2019;t blame me, but I knew he blamed himself for it, which made a situation that was already awkward even worse. And it frustrated me, because it gave him an excuse to avoid me.</p><p>Which is why I&#x2019;d put a lot of thought into the matter while I was mooning over life&#x2019;s subtle beauties.</p><p>&#x201c;It probably wouldn&#x2019;t have mattered, you know,&#x201d; I said to Cody. He looked blankly at me. &#x201c;You and me? Delaying the investigation?&#x201d; I shook my head. &#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t have mattered, Cody. We spent a couple of hours canvassing the neighborhood around the cemetery that morning. Either way, the thunderstorm would have passed through long before we went to Brannigan&#x2019;s house. That scent trail would have been gone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Cody ran a hand through his bronze-colored hair. &#x201c;I figured that out after I had a chance to cool down. We still should have started investigating right away and I&#x2019;m not letting myself off the hook for it, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not why I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;</p><p>Oh.</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I asked softly, regarding him. He wore a worn flannel shirt and faded jeans, and it looked good on him. Unlike a lot of men, Cody Fairfax could pull off backwoods chic. &#x201c;Are you here to give me the unsuitable-mate speech, Cody? Because I&#x2019;ve already heard it.&#x201d;</p><p>A corner of his mouth twitched wryly, but there was regret in his topaz eyes. &#x201c;Not the long version.&#x201d;</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>Cody glanced around the living room, his gaze lighting on the small steel buckler leaning against my bookcase. &#x201c;What the hell do you have a shield for, Daisy? Are you going to a Renaissance fair?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s for practicing. It helps me visualize a mental shield.&#x201d;</p><p>While I don&#x2019;t have any special powers per se, it turns out that thanks to my outsize emotions, I do have an abundance of what Stefan Ludovic&#x2014;hot ghoul, six-hundred-year-old immortal Bohemian knight, and the issue <i>I</i> was actively avoiding&#x2014;informed me the ancient Greeks called pneuma, or the breath of life, and George Lucas called the Force, or midi-chlorians. Just kidding on that last part. I don&#x2019;t think Stefan&#x2019;s seen <i>Star Wars</i>, although he has surprised me before. At any rate, under his tutelage, I&#x2019;ve learned to channel that energy into a mental shield, which is handy for warding off things like the emotion-draining ability of ghouls&#x2014;more politely known as the Outcast&#x2014;and vampiric hypnosis.</p><p>It can also be used as a weapon, which Stefan warned me was very, very dangerous, and that I should not attempt it before he gauged me ready. Given that I nearly got myself killed doing that very thing, I&#x2019;d say he was right.</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>&#x201c;Did Ludovic give that to you?&#x201d; Cody asked me, an edge to his tone. His nostrils flared slightly, and there was a glint of phosphorescent green in his eyes. In the bedroom doorway, Mogwai hissed and bristled.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He did.&#x201d; My heart ached a little. &#x201c;Goddammit, Cody! We&#x2019;ve been over this before, too. You can&#x2019;t have it both ways. You can&#x2019;t tell me I&#x2019;m an unsuitable mate, then act jealous. It&#x2019;s not fair.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, I know!&#x201d; Cody took a deep breath and wrestled himself under control. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;</p><p>I swallowed. &#x201c;Is this the long version of the speech?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said quietly. &#x201c;It is. You know I haven&#x2019;t been in a relationship since Caroline died&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve dated a ton of women!&#x201d; Not exactly a considerate response under the circumstances since he&#x2019;d just referenced his Canadian werewolf girlfriend who was tragically killed five years ago, but it was true.</p><p>&#x201c;Human women,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t count.&#x201d;</p><p>Being half human myself, I couldn&#x2019;t help feeling a surge of indignation. My tail lashed, and a few knickknacks on my bookshelves rattled in protest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it would warm their hearts to hear it.&#x201d;</p><p>Cody sighed. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean it like that. But it&#x2019;s not the same, and you know it.&#x201d;</p><p>Unfortunately, I did. The intensity of what I&#x2019;d experienced with Cody was unlike anything else I&#x2019;d ever known.</p><p>He shifted on the futon. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I never dated anyone for longer than a month. I never let it get serious. I never, ever misled anyone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I never said you misled me,&#x201d; I pointed out. &#x201c;And you also never dated anyone longer than a month because they might start noticing a conspicuous pattern of absence around the full moon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True.&#x201d; Cody gave me the ghost of a smile. &#x201c;But you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>I waited. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>His smile was gone. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting under my skin, Daise,&#x201d; he said simply. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t expecting it, but you surprised me.&#x201d;</p><p>Oh, crap. My heart gave another painful hitch. &#x201c;But.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I have a duty to my clan.&#x201d; Cody leaned forward and clasped his hands loosely between his spread knees. &#x201c;I know it doesn&#x2019;t seem fair, but it&#x2019;s not just one of those arbitrary eldritch protocols. The entire survival of our species depends on our mating and breeding with our own kind.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t have a &#x201c;but.&#x201d; There really wasn&#x2019;t anything to say.</p><p>&#x201c;My family&#x2019;s given me a lot of leeway since Caroline&#x2019;s death,&#x201d; Cody said. &#x201c;But at twenty-six, it&#x2019;s time I started thinking about settling down with a suitable mate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; I was just stalling now. &#x201c;Twenty-six is still young.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not when you run a higher than average risk of being shot by a hunter or a game warden,&#x201d; he murmured.</p><p>That was how his Canadian werewolf girlfriend had died. &#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Cody&#x2019;s gaze was candid and human. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not going to happen if we go any further with this, Pixy Stix.&#x201d;</p><p>Despite everything, I made a face at the nickname. &#x201c;Oh, gah!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; His lips curved into a rueful smile. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one of the ways I know I&#x2019;m getting in too deep. I find myself making up excuses to tease you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, if we were six and eight again, you&#x2019;d be pulling my pigtails on the playground at recess,&#x201d; I muttered.</p><p>&#x201c;Not at the risk of setting off your temper,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That old boiler at East Pemkowet Elementary was awfully touchy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me laugh,&#x201d; I pleaded.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; Cody rubbed his hands over his face. &#x201c;I really am, Daise. But I have to try to do the right thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what?&#x201d; I asked him. &#x201c;Does the Fairfax clan have someone in mind? Are you going to settle down with your second cousin?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; He dropped his hands to his knees. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re careful about bloodlines. With a relatively small gene pool, we have to be. Even wolves in the wild do their best to avoid intrafamilial breeding.&#x201d; He hesitated. &#x201c;Sometime in the next couple of months, the Fairfax clan will host a mixer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A mixer?&#x201d; I echoed.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; To his credit, Cody didn&#x2019;t look happy about it. In fact, he looked fairly miserable.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; I stood up. &#x201c;Well, thanks for telling me.&#x201d;</p><p>Cody stood, too. &#x201c;Daisy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I spread my arms. &#x201c;It is what it is, Cody. Like I said, you never misled me. I knew what you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wish I could share it with you, Daisy,&#x201d; he said to me. &#x201c;All of it.&#x201d; A distant, slightly dreamy expression crossed his face. &#x201c;The call of the full moon rising, a...</p></p><h2>Like Life</h2><p>In <b>Like Life</b>&#x2019;s<i> </i>eight exquisite stories, Lorrie Moore&#x2019;s characters stumble through their daily existence.

It shows that right from the start, relations at the top were prone to enormous strain, suspicions and accusations of betrayal. Yet it also shows the political and personal bonds that tied them together, and which made them one of the most feared and respected electoral machines anywhere in the world. <br>A story of politics in the raw, <i>Prelude to Power</i> is above all an intimate, detailed portrait of the people who have done so much to shape modern history.</p><p><strong>Alastair Campbell&nbsp;graduated from Cambridge University with a degree in modern languages. He worked for Blair, first as his press secrtary, then as official spokesman and director of communications and strategy from 1994 to 2003. He has been engaged in writing, public speaking, working for Leukaemia Research as chairman of fundraising, and continuing to advise Blair, Gordon Brown and other leading Labour figures. His first novel, <i>All In The Mind</i>, and an accompanying award-winning TV documentary, <i>Cracking Up</i>, led to him being voted Mind Champion of the Year.

The book equals Joe Orton's famous Diaries in providing an unblushing account of a gay lifestyle linked to entertainment. Full of outrageous fictions and touching truths, in telling surreal and outrageous lies Graham Chapman often uncovers a truth about himself and colleagues. The stories Chapman relates&#x2014;whether as mountaineer or medical student (he was a doctor); actor or alcoholic (he was both); heterosexual groupie-guzzler or homosexual coming to terms with himself (bit of both)&#x2014;form a surreal and crowded mosaic that is funny, disturbing, and moving by turns.

He achieved his fame by uncovering the cities Troy and Mycenae. And if it wasn't the Troy of the Trojan War or the Mycenae of Agamemnon, as Schliemann claimed, the value of his discovery, in terms of archeology and pure treasure, is still indisputable. Like <i>Schliemann of Troy</i> by David Traill, Caroline Moorehead uncovers Schliemann's arrogance and his propensity to exaggerate, if not lie outright. But she's not so focused on his faults that she's blind to his strengths.British writer Moorehead (Bertrand Russell, 1993, etc.) rounds out her sympathetic treatment of Heinrich Schliemann with the events leading to the recent rediscovery in Moscow of the Trojan treasures he unearthed. Both Schliemann's scholarly reputation as an archaeologist of the Mycenaean period and his legendary status as the discoverer of Homer's Troy have come under recent attack, just as his initial claims caused both furor and admiration. Although David Traill's iconoclastic biography, Schliemann of Troy (1996), meticulously sifted through his life to lay bare his misrepresentations and outright frauds, Moorehead is a steadfast, enthusiastic partisan. She grudgingly adds a few warts but does not dwell on them. Her loyalty is still to the legend of the grocer's-apprentice-turned- millionaire and self-made archaeologist who went in search of Troy. Although she notes his workaholic egomania, squabbles with colleagues, self-promoting reports, doctored journals, smuggling, and overimaginative and untrustworthy accounts of some of his findings, she glosses over them as venal sins in light of his groundbreaking work, not to mention the gold and silver artifacts he romantically attributed to Homeric heroes. Although by modern standards his methodology was mendacious and his digging technique more like strip-mining, there is no denying what his second wife and on-site helpmeet called his ``truffle-dog instincts.'' In a sensational and historically ironic pendant, Moorehead's investigation into the whereabouts of these treasures picks up with WW II, when the Berlin collection was looted by Soviet troops in retribution for the Nazis' cultural vandalism, and closes with the treasures' rediscovery by two Soviet art historians in 1990, to the embarrassment of the Minstry of Culture. (The treasures are currently on exhibit in Moscow.) In a fair trade-off for a good read, Moorehead bypasses recent unearthings of Schliemann's flaws in favor of a celebration of his inspiring achievements and a retracing of the convoluted trail of his legacy to the present day.

With more than 70 years in existence, the journal witnessed significant moments in the history of typography and graphic design. 30 Years of Swiss Typographic Discourse in the Typografische Monatsblatter examines the years 1960-90, that correspond to a period of transition in which many factors such as technology, socio-political contexts and aesthetic ideologies profoundly affected and transformed the fields of typography and graphic design.

Her many books include <i>Victory or Death: Stories of the American Revolution; We Are The Many: A Picture Book of American Indians;</i> and <i>Martin&#x2019;s Big Words</i>, winner of the Jane Addams Book Award. She and her husband divide their time between New York City and a rural village in upstate New York. </p>Kindergarten-Grade 3 There really was a ``Boston Coffee Party'' during the American Revolution in which women punished a selfish merchant who was hoarding his coffee bean stock during the wartime shortage until the price was high enough for profit. Rappaport tells a story based on this historic detail from the point of view of two young sisters of that time, in words that are easy to read but convey the feelings of the time and the action of the plot. Greedy merchant Thomas has already held back sugar; when they find him doing the same with coffee, the women of the sewing circle plan their ``party'' for revenge. Although their knowledge of history and of the original Boston Tea Party may be vague, young readers and listeners have probably seen and heard enough about the American Revolutionary period and its costumes to enjoy and appreciate the story, which can stand on its own. McCully's competent line drawings with watercolor and charcoal create a sense of time and place while they convey the action through movement and gesture. Sylvia S.

She made her literary debut in 1947 with the collection of poems, <i>Zore i vihori </i>(<i>Dawns and Hurricanes</i>), and over the next 60 years went on to publish more than twenty books of poetry, as well as essays, criticism, and children's books. And, although Croatian lyrical is a strong and fruitful tradition, until Vesna Parun, it did not know a single female poet with such developed sensibilities and poetic expressiveness: Parun's modus vivendi was "it is love that makes and keeps us human." And while there are many poets in Croatian literature who have written collections of love poetry, about love of a woman as an object, here we have poems about love with a woman as subject. The poems in this edition are deeply moving, and great examples of language that exposes Eastern European culture to the English-speaking world&#x2014;a volume that captures the feeling, essence, rhythm, and depth of the author's words as best as English can through superb translations.</p><p><b>Vesna Parun</b> was a Croatin free artist, writing poetry, essays, criticism and children's literature, and translated works from Slovene, German, French and Bulgarian. <b>Dasha C.

Their films are quirky, arresting, comic, and intelligent. Not given to talking publicly about their work, they have given access to William Preston Robertson and Tricia Cooke to interview the cast and crew of their latest film, <em>The Big Lebowski</em>. In a prose style that complements the Coens's filmic one, the book discusses the Coens's oeuvre, the themes of their films, their atypical brand of humor, their craft and their artistic vision. Several scenes of <em>The Big Lebowski</em> are examined closely to see how the movie goes from idea to reality, making this an ideal book for fans, filmmakers, and filmmaking students.<br><br><em>The Big Lebowski</em> is a razor-sharp comedy thriller of mistaken identity, gangsters, bowling, kidnapping, and money gone astray, written by the Coens, directed by Joel Coen, and produced by Ethan Coen. In addition to Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, the film stars Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, John Turturro, Willem DaFoe, Sam Elliot, and Ben Gazzara.<br> 32 full-color photographs and 130 black-and-white photographs and illustrations</p><p>Since their debut with <i>Blood Simple</i> in 1984, Joel and Ethan Coen have created a unique body of work that seems to project their combined imaginations directly onto the movie screen. By concentrating on the filming of their homage to Raymond Chandler, <i>The Big Lebowski</i>, this book provides a great deal of insight into the way that these extraordinary filmmakers take an idea and transform it into a movie. <p> Text and illustrations combine to reveal the Coens' combination of quirkiness and craft, and the ways that the singular (or is it binary?) vision of the brothers combines with actors and crew in the group effort necessary to produce a finished film. This book doesn't attempt a critical analysis of the work of Joel and Ethan Coen--the complexity of their vision resists such an approach. Instead, we're treated to a fly-on-the-wall view of the creative process, and it's enough to get the most casual film lover to grab a notebook, rent a camera, and start making movies! <i>--Simon Leake</i></p><p><strong>Tricia Cooke</strong>, an editor on the Coens's films, is married to Ethan Coen and lives in New York.</p><p><strong>William Preston Robertson</strong> is a screenwriter, documentarian, and journalist living in New York City.</p></p><h2>Paul Cezanne: How He Amazed The World (Adventures in Art)</h2><p>Young readers will delight in this journey through Proven�e as they learn about colors, shapes, and composition from a master of modern art. <p>Like children everywhere, Paul C�zanne painted what was familiar to him: his family, his surroundings, and the objects in and around his home.

These flowers are common in instructional brush painting books because of their special symbolism in Chinese culture. In <i>Chinese Brush Painting: Flowers</i>, artists will have the opportunity to explore a more diverse range of blooms with the expert guidance of award-winning artist and instructor Joan Lok. Starting with the basics of materials, brushwork, and the five Chinese brush-painting methods, then moving into paint consistency, creating blends of color, and understanding flower anatomy, Lok will guide and inspire the artist to paint any flower in the garden with skill and confidence. Thirty six projects include:</p><ul><li>Sunflower</li><li>Day Lily</li><li>Rose</li><li>Morning Glory</li><li>Stargazer Lily, and many others</li></ul><p>Each flower includes specific technical emphasis, a suggested palette of colors, and illustrated, step-by-step instructions. <i>Chinese Brush Painting: Flowers</i> is a down-to-earth and accessible teaching guide for all levels of artist, from beginner up. More than 250 full-color illustrations throughout.</p></p><p>Joan Lok has won numerous awards internationally for her luminous floral paintings. Her work has been published in <i>The Best of Flower Paintings</i>, <i>Strokes of Genius 2</i>, and other art collections. She taught Asian American Arts at the University of Maryland, and conducts workshops across America."Artist Lok introduces readers to traditional styles of Chinese brush flower painting, which are a bit freer than that of English garden botanical painting. A handy visual directory of flowers allows readers to choose exercises by plant or color scheme.

It is unmatched as a turbulent period in national history, and at a local level in County Galway. Despite this, there has been no local survey of the period until now. Galway from 1910 to 1923 often seems paradoxical. A highly disruptive county with many of the island&#39;s poorest inhabitants, Galway appeared ready to erupt once politics were radicalized in the absence of emigration during the years of the Great War (1914-1918). Yet revolution - as seen in Tipperary, Cork, and elsewhere - was never to materialize. By any standards of assessment, Galway saw only low intensity fighting throughout the revolutionary years. However, there is no denying that the contribution of Galway - small in many respects - cannot be dismissed from the annals of the War of Independence. The same is true of the Civil War. (Series: Maynooth Studies in Local History - Number 95)</p><p></p><h2>Monet and Japan: An Exhibition Organised by the National Gallery of Australia</h2><p>Monet never traveled to Japan, but he surrounded himself with a large collection of Japanese woodblock prints. Like a number of other Parisians, he first collected Japanese prints in the 1860s. He shared the European view of Japanese culture as supremely artistic, shaped by the refined aesthetic tastes of its people, in harmony with its legendary beauty. As early as the 1870s, critics were writing about the influence of Japanese art on Monet&#39;s Impression. Monet and Japan shows how Japanese prints and paintings helped to shape Monet&#39;s art during six decades, influencing not only his style and subject matter, but the very way he saw the world around him. It includes Japanese prints and paintings that we know Monet saw, or could have seen, or works very like them. The book also contains Monet&#39;s paintings of his pays, that part of France which he knew best, where he was born and brought up--the Seine Valley from Le Havre on the Norman coast to Paris. It is in his paintings of the landscapes that he knew intimately that one can best observe how Monet used Japanese art to shape his vision of his world.</p><p>ART</p><h2>500 Years of Golf Balls: History &amp; Collector's Guide</h2><p>The first book to cover the complete history of the golf ball, with classifications, descriptions, and prices for old and new balls.

This edition remains true to the literary grace of earlier editions as it expands its scope, increasing the emphasis on pluralism, religious practices, and spiritual seeking, as well as the direct connection of religion to social and political struggle. The authors have updated the structure of the text, replacing the five distinct ages of Gaustad's previous editions with a more explicit emphasis on specific historical markers, carrying the multifaceted story of religion in the United States into the twenty-first century.</p><p>Extensively illustrated, and with a new emphasis on African-American and Native American religious life, Eastern religions, and the recent boom in spirituality, this new edition of <em>The Religious History of America</em> is the master telling of the heart and soul of the American story.</p></p><p>A thoroughly researched, profusely illustrated, and fully updated edition of this major history of religion in America.Edwin S. Gaustad is a professor of history at the University of California, Riverside. He is a noted church historian and the author of over a dozen books, including <em> The Great Awakening in New England, Dissent in American Religion,</em> and <em> A Religious History of America.</em></p><h2>Conundrum</h2><p>The writer Jan Morris has led an extraordinary life. Perhaps her most remarkable work is this honest account of her ten-year transition from man to woman - its pains and joys, its frustrations and discoveries.</p><p>"This is a beautiful book.&nbsp; I found it to be melancholic, courageous, and wise.&nbsp; That it's subject matter is Jan Morris's transsexual journey almost seems secondary to&nbsp;her incredible prose and the clarity of her honesty and introspection.&nbsp; Beyond the issue of gender, she&nbsp;searches for an answer&nbsp;to that most elusive of questions: who am I?" -- Jonathan AmesJan Morris was born in 1926 of a Welsh father and an English mother, and when she is not travelling she lives with her partner Elizabeth Morris in the top left-hand corner of Wales, between the mountains and the sea. Her books include Coronation Everest, Venice, The Pax Britannica Trilogy (Heaven&#39;s Command, Pax Britannica, and Farewell the Trumpets), and Conundrum. She is also the author of six books about cities and countries, two autobiographical books, several volumes of collected travel essays and the unclassifiable Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere.

Kim&#x2019;s regime insults all of us. Its very existence is an affront to humanity&#x2019;s sense of decency and challenges accepted notions of politics, economics, and social theory. More important, North Korea threatens us.<br><br>The Great Leader, as Kim now calls himself, can change the course of history with an act of unimaginable devastation. He possesses an arsenal of nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles to deliver them. Today he can hit most of the continent of Asia and even parts of the American homeland. In a few years&#x2013;probably by the end of this decade&#x2013;the diminutive despot will cast his shadow across the globe: He will be able to land a nuke on any point on the planet. <br><br>Even now, everyone is at risk. North Korea has said it might sell weapons to others, thereby making itself the first &#x201c;nuclear Kmart.&#x201d; Who wants to live in a world where anyone with enough cash and a pickup truck can incinerate a city?<br><br>For six decades, America has tried every tactic to stop Kim&#x2019;s Korea, but it has failed each time. The current approach&#x2013;providing aid and assurances of security in return for an end to weapons programs&#x2013;mimics the failed diplomacy of the 1990s. Negotiations, sponsored by China, have yet to produce an enduring solution. <br><br>Unfortunately, Kim has paid no price for destabilizing the global order. In fact, many countries, including America, reward him for his fundamental challenge to the international system. Perhaps that is why the world is now further away from a solution to the Korean nuclear crisis than it was a decade ago. <br><br>In a contest that will be decided by finesse more than power, Kim is winning. If he ultimately prevails&#x2013;and time is running out for Washington&#x2013;his success will probably result in a quick erosion of American power. The world&#x2019;s strongest nation does not have much of a future if it cannot defend its most vital interests against a reviled autocrat like Kim from a small country like North Korea.<br><br>The current conflict with Kim Jong Il is a crisis like no other, perhaps the twenty-first century&#x2019;s moment of greatest consequence. This is where the world writes its history for the next hundred years. <i>Nuclear Showdown</i> is the first and only major study to look at all dimensions of this crisis. Gordon G. Chang proposes solutions that go beyond the conventional suggestions seen elsewhere.</p><p>Gordon G. Chang lived and worked in China and Hong Kong for nearly two decades. He has written for numerous publications, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the Far Eastern Economic Review, and the South China Morning Post, and is frequent lecturer at universities and other institutions in the United States and abroad. He is author of The Coming Collapse of China.Chapter 1<br><br> KU KLUX KOREA<br><br> America Creates a Renegade Nation People that are really very weird can get into sensitive positions and have a tremendous impact on history.<br><br> &#x2014;Dan Quayle, former American vice president<br><br> North Korea insults us. Its very existence is an affront to our sense of decency, perhaps even to the idea of human progress. At a fundamental level it challenges our notions of politics, economics, and social theory. The Democratic People&#x2019;s Republic of Korea&#x2014;or DPRK as it calls itself&#x2014;is not only different, but abhorrent.<br><br> We abhor something we do not understand. The nation ruled from Pyongyang is seemingly impenetrable; natural and artificial barriers wall it off. Yet the biggest impediment to comprehending North Korea is its very nature: the country defies conventional characterization. We call it communist&#x2014;but it hardly resembles the other four nations sharing that label. After all, communism, which claims to be the wave of the future, implies modernity. North Korea, on the other hand, is not just backward, it is essentially feudal, even medieval. Many say that the nation is Stalinist, but that&#x2019;s true only in the broadest sense of the term. Joseph Stalin himself would have been uncomfortable had he ever visited Pyongyang. The regime founded by Kim Il Sung is a cult possessing instruments of a nation-state, a militant clan with embassies and weapons of mass destruction. Kim, unrestrained by normal standards of conduct, created an aberrant society of almost unimaginable cruelty. North Korea is in a category by itself.<br><br> It is, from almost any perspective, the worst country in the world. The University of Chicago&#x2019;s Bruce Cumings, known for nuanced views, calls the nation &#x201c;repellent,&#x201d; and American analyst Selig Harrison, always sympathetic toward Pyongyang, admits it&#x2019;s &#x201c;Orwellian.&#x201d; Even leftist Noam Chomsky notes the country is &#x201c;a pretty crazy place.&#x201d; How could any nation go so wrong?<br><br> The Unfortunate Peninsula<br><br> It took centuries of tragedy to produce today&#x2019;s Koreans, who have endured five major occupations and about nine hundred invasions during their history. Unfortunately for them, the Korean peninsula is where China, Japan, and Russia meet, and so their nation has historically been a prize for powerful neighbors. Yet as painful as its story has been, the last century and a half has been particularly harsh for &#x201c;the shrimp among whales,&#x201d; as the people of Korea call their homeland. Perhaps it is no coincidence that this is also the period since the United States became involved in Korean affairs.<br><br> America&#x2019;s first contact with the Hermit Kingdom was a memorable occasion, at least for the hermits. In 1866 the General Sherman, a steam schooner, chugged up the Taedong River toward Pyongyang. After ignoring warnings to turn back from the locals, who were not interested in either American trade or Christian religion, the ship was torched and the crew killed and dismembered.<br><br> Despite the unpleasantness in the Taedong River, the Koreans eventually found some use for Americans. In 1882 they signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce with Washington. This pact, their first with a Western nation, was intended as a defensive measure to ward off Korea&#x2019;s more immediately threatening neighbors.<br><br> The Korean king danced with joy on the arrival of the first American envoy, but that was premature: in a few years Washington would sell out their newfound Korean friends. The Japanese and the Russians were both interested in controlling Korea, and Tokyo proposed dividing the peninsula into spheres of influence along the 38th parallel. The tsar refused. These two powers could not peacefully reconcile their expansionist ambitions. The Japanese humiliated Moscow&#x2019;s forces in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904&#x2013;05, the first defeat of a European power by an Asian one in modern history. President Theodore Roosevelt brokered the peace, which confirmed Japanese control over Korea. As part of the deal, Washington secretly obtained Tokyo&#x2019;s assurance that it would not challenge its control of the Philippines. Roosevelt received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.<br><br> An American won the award, and Korea paid the price. As a result of Roosevelt&#x2019;s peace, Japan occupied Korea in 1905 and annexed the place outright five years later. In obliterating the Korean nation, the Japanese brought an end to one of the longest imperial reigns in Asian history, the Choson Dynasty, founded in 1392. Japan&#x2019;s occupation was especially cruel: the peninsula&#x2019;s new masters tried to kill off the concept of Korea. They forced their subjects to take Japanese names and tried to expunge the Korean language. Japan imported Shinto, its religion, and taught a new history to schoolchildren. Millions of Korean men and women were impressed into the Japanese war effort, many taken from their homeland. Koreans had to swear loyalty to the emperor in Tokyo.<br><br> It took Japan&#x2019;s defeat in World War II to end the occupation. Although Japanese troops went home, Korea, which technically did not exist during the fighting, was the Second World War&#x2019;s big loser. The Cairo Declaration of 1943 stated that &#x201c;in due course, Korea shall become free and independent,&#x201d; but events&#x2014;and the Allies themselves&#x2014;conspired against the Korean people. America, concerned about the casualties resulting from a potential invasion of the Japanese homeland, persuaded the Soviet Union to declare war against Tokyo, which it finally did on August 8, 1945, just seven days before the emperor capitulated. Washington slammed the door on a Soviet occupation of Japan but permitted Moscow a slice of Korea. The Red Army, without firing a shot, invaded the northern part of the Korean peninsula on August 9.<br><br> Washington had given no thought in the closing days of the war about what to do with Korea. There were no American troops there, and to avoid a Soviet takeover of the whole peninsula the United States hastily proposed its division. As August 10 became the 11th in the American capital, two junior American Army officers, consulting a National Geographic map, picked the 38th parallel as the border for &#x201c;temporary&#x201d; occupation zones. By selecting a line with historical significance, Lieutenant Colonel Dean Rusk, later to become secretary of state, and his colleague inadvertently signaled to Moscow that the United States recognized the tsar&#x2019;s old claim to the northern portion of Korea. Whatever the Soviets thought, they accepted, and honored, the proposed dividing line. Korea, which had been unified for more than a millennium, was severed.<br><br> Korea&#x2019;s division was an afterthought. There was no justification for the act&#x2014;if any country deserved dismemberment, it was Japan. In different times, there might have been no consequence to the last-minute decision to split the peninsula into two. In the global competition developing between Moscow and Washington, however, the stopgap measure took on significance. As every business consultant knows, there is nothing as permanent as a temporary solution, and Korea proved this proposition. National elections, to be sponsored by the United Nations, were never held. Eventually each side established its own client state. The American-backed Republic of Korea was officially proclaimed on August 15, 1948, and the Soviet-supported Democratic People&#x2019;s Republic of Korea was officially born less than a month later.<br><br> The new arrangement was in trouble from the beginning. Each of the two states claimed to be the sole representative of the Korean people, and both of them were raring for a fight. Neither big-power sponsor stayed around long to restrain its young ward. Soviet troops were off the Korean peninsula by late 1948, and the Americans decamped by June 1949. Two jealous children were left to settle their fate in zero-sum fashion. Both sides conducted guerrilla raids and battalion-size incursions across the 38th parallel.<br><br> On June 25, 1950, Kim Il Sung, the North&#x2019;s leader, initiated full-scale war by sending his tanks and troops south. President Harry Truman intervened immediately to stop what he perceived to be a Soviet test of Western resolve. The United Nations, prompted by Washington, showed remarkable resolve of its own: for the first time in history a world organization decided, in the words of historian David McCullough, &#x201c;to use armed force to stop armed force.&#x201d;<br><br> Despite the unified response of the West, Kim&#x2019;s reunification policy almost succeeded. The North Koreans took Seoul in less than a week and had almost the entire peninsula under their control in a little over a month. Kim&#x2019;s forces were then beaten back almost to the Chinese border by troops from seventeen countries under the United Nations command led by General Douglas MacArthur. Chinese &#x201c;volunteers&#x201d; crossed the Yalu River into North Korea beginning in late October and pushed the American-led coalition south of Seoul by the end of 1950. During the remainder of the war the United Nations forces&#x2014;primarily Americans&#x2014;advanced only slightly northward during a period of essentially stalemated conflict.<br><br> The fighting during the &#x201c;Great Fatherland Liberation War,&#x201d; as the North Koreans call it, lasted for three years and one month. Negotiations went on almost as long: they continued for two years and nineteen days. There were 158 plenary sessions before the parties could agree, and even then they only arrived at an interim arrangement, a cease-fire. To this day there has been no treaty formally ending the conflict, so the war technically continues.<br><br> Alt...</p><h2>SS-Leibstandarte: The History of the First SS Division, 1933-45</h2><p>This in-depth examination of the first Waffen-SS unit explores its genesis as Hitler&#39;s bodyguard detachment, the men it recruited, key figures involved and its organization. A full combat record of the SS-Leibstandarte, which fought on both fronts of the European theater, is accompanied by rare, archival photography, descriptions of training methods and depictions of uniforms and insignia.</p><p>The First one formed, the Fuhrer (Adolf Hitler) beloved one, recipient of teh best, men, weapons. But also the one that provided more war criminals, and the first one to renegade the Fuhrer, This is the story rude, crude and without passion of the Leibsstandarte Adolf Hitler or LSAH. Formed iniatially as the pretorian guard of Hitler, the LSAH, would become in 19-40-45, the most feared and most effective german formation of the Waffen SS and probably of teh German Armed Forces, with members devoted to death for the Fuhrer and fot the Vaterland, they were and are still a fine example of what is made an Elite soldier, but they were also, and thats why usually they are rememberd for, blood thirsty criminals, brain washed to the superiority of the Arian race, and they would pay for the best and the worse they had after May 1945. But until the end of the war they palyed part on some of the most bloody battles ever fought by any unit of teh waffen ss, and they suffered much more losses than any other unit of any army in WW2, simply because they were the best, and they didn't surrender. This book shows all the history and life of the LSAH, and the odds they faced against superior enemy forces, often in a 1:100. I recommend this book as well as the one on the 2dn Waffen SS Division Das Reich, because you can see how different the waffen ss were from division to division, and how they did compete for the excellence in battle, at the cost of their one existance. --By alex mariano<br><br>Finally an author who employs fact rather than overblown biases.

Her barrister husband, Ronald Rougier, provided many of the plots for her detective novels, which are classic English country house mysteries reminiscent of Agatha Christie. Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy, inventive plots, and sparkling characterization.<p><b>One</b></p> <p>There was a twinkle in the Nonesuch's eye as he scanned the countenances of his assembled relations, but his voice was perfectly grave, even a trifle apologetic. &#x2018;I am afraid it is quite true, ma'am,' he said, addressing himself to his Aunt Sophia. &#x2018;I am the heir.'</p> <p>Since the question, so indignantly posed by Lady Lindeth, had been rhetorical, this very frank and manly confession surprised no one. They all knew that old Cousin Joseph Calver had left his fortune to Waldo; and when Lady Lindeth had summoned him to account for himself she had acted on the impulse of the moment, and with no expectation of hearing the news denied. Nor had she had any very real expectation of Waldo's renouncing the bequest in favour of her only child. She naturally felt that no worthier heir to eccentric Cousin Joseph's estate existed than Julian; and she had done her best to introduce the noble orphan to him, even enduring the rigours of a week spent at Harrogate, when Julian had been an engaging child in nankeens and a frilled shirt, and she had tried (quite unavailingly) to gain entrance to Broom Hall. Three times had she driven out from Harrogate, the bored but docile little boy beside her, only to be told, twice, by Cousin Joseph's butler, that the Master was not feeling clever enough to receive visitors; and, once, that the Master would thank her not to come pestering him, because he didn't want to see her, nor her son, nor anyone else. Enquiry had elicited the information that the only visitor ever admitted into the house was the doctor. Local opinion was divided, charitable persons maintaining that a disappointment suffered in his youth was responsible for this churlishness; others asserting that he was a muckworm who grudged every groat he was obliged to spend. Having had the opportunity to perceive the neglected condition of the grounds of Broom Hall, Lady Lindeth had ranged herself with the majority. A suspicion that Cousin Joseph might not be as plump in the pocket as was supposed had occurred only to be dismissed: Broom Hall, though greatly inferior in style and size to young Lord Lindeth's seat in the Midlands, was a very respectable house, with probably as many as thirty bedrooms. It did not stand in a park, but its gardens appeared to be extensive; and she was credibly informed that most of the surrounding land belonged to the estate. She had left Harrogate much inclined to think that Cousin Joseph's fortune was considerably larger than had previously been supposed. She did not grudge it to him, but she would have thought herself a very unnatural parent had she not made a push to secure it for her son. So she had swallowed her resentment at the treatment she had received, and had continued, throughout the succeeding years, to send Joseph small Christmas gifts, and periodical letters, affectionately enquiring after the state of his health, and regaling him with accounts of Julian's virtues, beauty, and scholastic progress. And after all her pains he had left his entire estate to Waldo, who was neither the most senior of his relations nor the one who bore his name!</p> <p>The most senior of the three cousins gathered together in Lady Lindeth's drawing-room was George Wingham, the son of her ladyship's eldest sister. He was a very worthy man, however prosy; she was not particularly fond of him, but she thought she could have borne it better had Cousin Joseph made him his heir, for she was obliged to acknowledge that his seniority gave him a certain amount of right to the bequest. Not, of course, so good a right as Laurence Calver. Lady Lindeth held Laurence, the youngest of her nephews, in contempt and dislike, but she hoped she was a just woman, and she felt she could have supported with equanimity his succession to a fortune which he would have lost no time in dissipating.</p> <p>But that Cousin Joseph, ignoring the claims of George, and Laurence, and her beloved Julian, should have named Waldo Hawkridge as his heir was so intolerable that had she been of a nervous disposition she thought she must have succumbed to Spasms when she had first heard the incredible news. As it was, she had been unable to speak for a full minute; and when she did she had merely uttered Waldo's name, in a voice so vibrant with loathing that Julian, the bearer of the tidings, had been startled. &#x2018;But, Mama-!' he had expostulated. &#x2018;You like Waldo!'</p> <p>That was perfectly true, but quite beside the point, as she crossly told her son. She was, in fact, much attached to Waldo, but neither her fondness for him nor her gratitude for his unfailing kindness to Julian prevented her from feeling positively unwell whenever she thought of his enormous wealth. To learn that Cousin Joseph's estate was to be added to an already indecently large fortune did make her feel for a few minutes that so far from liking him she detested him.</p> <p>She said now, in a peevish tone: &#x2018;I can't conceive what should have induced that disagreeable old man to choose you for his heir!'</p> <p>&#x2018;There is no understanding it at all,' Sir Waldo replied sympathetically.</p> <p>&#x2018;I don't believe you ever so much as saw him, either!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, I never did.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, I must own,' said George, &#x2018;that it was an odd sort of a thing to do. One would have thought However, none of us had the least claim on the old fellow, and I'm sure he had a perfect right to leave his money where he chose!'</p> <p>At this, Laurence Calver, who had been lounging on the sofa, and moodily playing with an ornate quizzing-glass, let the glass fall on the end of its ribbon, and jerked himself up, saying angrily: &#x2018;You had no claim to it or Waldo or Lindeth! But I'm a Calver! I I think it damnable!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Very possibly!' snapped his aunt. &#x2018;But you will be good enough not to use such language in my presence, if you please!'</p> <p>He coloured, and mumbled an apology, but the reproof did nothing to improve his temper, and he embarked on a long and incoherent diatribe, which ranged stammeringly over a wide ground, embracing all the real and fancied causes of his sense of ill-usage, the malevolence of Joseph Calver, and the suspected duplicity of Waldo Hawkridge.</p> <p>Until George Wingham intervened, he was heard in unresponsive silence. His oblique animadversions on Sir Waldo's character did indeed bring a flash into Lord Lindeth's eyes, but he folded his lips tightly on a retort. Laurence had always been jealous of Waldo: everyone knew that; and very ludicrous it was to watch his attempts to outshine his cousin. He was several years younger than Waldo, and he possessed none of the attributes which Nature had so generously bestowed on the Nonesuch. Failing to excel in any of the sports which had won for Waldo his title, he had lately turned towards the dandy-set, abandoning the sporting attire of the Corinthian for all the extravagances of fashion popular amongst the young dandies. Julian, three years his junior, thought that he looked ridiculous in any guise; and instinctively turned his eyes towards Waldo. They warmed as they looked, for to Julian Sir Waldo was at once a magnificent personage in whose company it was an honour to be seen, the big cousin who had taught him to ride, drive, shoot, fish, and box; a fount of wisdom; and the surest refuge in times of stress. He had even taught him something of his own way with the starched folds of a neckcloth: not the intricacies of the Mathematical or the Oriental Tie, but an elegant fashion of his own, as unobtrusive as it was exquisite. Laurence would do well to imitate the quiet neatness of Waldo's dress, Julian thought, not realizing that the plain, close-fitting coats which so admirably became Waldo could only be worn to advantage by men of splendid physique. Less fortunate aspirants to high fashion were obliged to adopt a more florid style, with padding to disguise sloping shoulders, and huge, laid-back lapels to widen a narrow chest.</p> <p>He glanced again at Laurence, not so much folding his lips as gripping them tightly together, to keep back the retort he knew Waldo didn't wish him to utter. From vapourings about the injustice of fate, Laurence, working himself into a passion, was becoming more particular in his complaints. Any stranger listening to him would have supposed that Waldo was wealthy at his expense, Julian thought indignantly: certainly that Waldo had always treated him shabbily. Well, whether Waldo liked it or not, he was not going to sit meekly silent any longer!</p> <p>But before he could speak George had intervened, saying in a voice of grim warning: &#x2018;Take care! If anyone has cause to be grateful to Waldo, you have, you distempered young Jack-at-warts!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, George, don't be a fool!' begged Sir Waldo.</p> <p>His stolid senior paid no heed to this, but kept his stern gaze on Laurence. &#x2018;Who paid your Oxford debts?' he demanded. &#x2018;Who gets you out of sponging-houses? Who saved you from the devil's own mess, not a month ago? I know to what tune you were bit at that hell in Pall Mall! no, it wasn't Waldo who told me, so you needn't cast any of your black looks at him! The Sharps tried on the grand mace with you, didn't they? Lord, it was all hollow for them! You were born a bleater!'</p> <p>&#x2018;That's enough!' Waldo interrupted.</p> <p>&#x2018;It is! More than enough!' said George rebelliously.</p> <p>&#x2018;Tell me, Laurie,' said Waldo, ignoring this interpolation, &#x2018;do you want a house in Yorkshire?'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, but what do you want with it? Why should you have it? You've got Manifold you've got a town house you've got that place in Leicestershire and you ain't even a Calver!'</p> <p>&#x2018;And what the devil has that to say to anything?' struck in George. &#x2018;What have the Calvers to do with Manifold, pray? Or with the house in Charles Street? Or with '</p> <p>&#x2018;George, if you don't hold your tongue we shall be at outs, you and I!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, very well!' growled George. &#x2018;But when that ramshackle court-card starts talking as though he thought he ought to own Manifold, which has been in your family since the lord knows when !'</p> <p>&#x2018;He doesn't think anything of the sort. He thinks merely that he ought to own Broom Hall. But what would you do with it if you did own it, Laurie? I haven't seen it, but I collect it's a small estate, subsisting on the rents of various farms and holdings. Have you a fancy for setting up as an agriculturist?'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, I have not!' replied Laurence angrily. &#x2018;If that sneaking screw had left it to me, I'd have sold it which I don't doubt you'll do as though you weren't swimming in riches already!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, you would have sold it, and wasted its price within six months. Well, I can put it to better use than that.' The smile crept back into his eyes; he said consolingly: &#x2018;Does it comfort you to know that it won't add to my riches? It won't: quite the reverse, I daresay!'</p> <p>Mr Wingham directed a sharply suspicious look at him, but it was Lady Lindeth who spoke, exclaiming incredulously: &#x2018;What? Do you mean to tell me that that detestable old man wasn't possessed of a handsome fortune after all?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Doing it rather too brown!' said Laurence, his not uncomely features marred by a sneer.</p> <p>&#x2018;I can't tell you yet what he was possessed of, ma'am, but I've been given no reason to suppose that he's made me heir to more than a competence deriving, I collect, from the estate. And as you and George have both frequently described to me the deplorable state of decay into which the place has fallen I should imagine that the task of bringing it into order is likely to swallow the revenue, and a good deal more besides.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Is that what you mean to do?' asked Julian curiously. &#x2018;Bring it into order?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Possibly: I can't tell, until I've seen it.'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, of course Waldo, you know I don't want it, but what the dooce do you Oh!' He broke off, laughing, and said mischievously: &#x2018;I'll swear I know, but I won't tell George word of a Lindeth!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Tell me?' said George, with a scornful snort. &#x2018;Do you take me for a flat, young sauce-box? He wants it for another Orphan Asylum, of course!'</p> <p>&#x2018;An Orphan Asylum!' Laurence jerked himself to his feet, staring at Sir Waldo with narrowed, glittering eyes. &#x2018;So that's it, is it? What ought to be mine is to be squandered on the staff and raff of the back-slums! You don't want it yourself, but you'd rather by far benefit a set of dirty, worthless brats than your own kith and kin!'</p> <p>&#x2018;I don't think you are concerned with any of my kith and kin other than yourself, Laurie,' replied Sir Waldo. &#x2018;That being so yes, I would.'</p> <p>&#x2018;You you By God, you make me sick!' Laurence said, trembling with fury.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, take yourself off!' recommended Julian, as flushed as Laurence was pale. &#x2018;You only came here to nose out what you might, and you've done that! And if you think you're at liberty to insult Waldo under any roof of mine I'll have you know you're much mistaken!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Make yourself easy: I'm going, toad-eater!' Laurence flung at him. &#x2018;And you need not put yourself to the trouble of escorting me downstairs! Ma'am, your very obedient servant!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Tragedy Jack!' remarked George, as the door slammed behind the outraged dandy. &#x2018;Well-done, young 'un!' He added, with a grin that suddenly lightened his rather heavy countenance: &#x2018;You and your roofs! Try telling me I came to nose out what I might and see what I'll do to you!'</p> <p>Julian laughed, relaxing. &#x2018;Well, you did, but that's different! You don't grudge Cousin Joseph's property to Waldo any more than I do!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, but that ain't to say I don't grudge it to those curst brats of his!' said George frankly. He was himself a man of substance, but he was also the father of a large and hopeful family, and although he would have repudiated with indignation any suggestion that he was not very well able to provide for his children, he had for years been unable to consider his unknown and remote cousin's problematical fortune without thinking that it would furnish him with a useful addition to his own estate. He was neither an unkindly nor an ungenerous man; he subscribed what was proper to Charity; but he did feel that Waldo carried the thing to excess. That, of course, was largely the fault of his upbringing: his father, the late Sir Thurstan Hawkridge, had been a considerable philanthropist; but George could not remember that he had ever gone to such absurd lengths as to succour and educate the lord only knew how many of the nameless and gallows-born waifs with which every city was ridden.</p> <p>He looked up, to find that Waldo was watching him, the faintest hint of a question in his eyes. He reddened, saying roughly: &#x2018;No, I don't want Broom Hall, and I hope I know better than to waste my time recommending you not to drop your blunt providing for a parcel of paupers who won't thank you for it, and, you may depend upon it, won't grow up to be the respectable citizens you think they will, either! But I must say I do wonder what made that old miser leave his money to you!'</p> <p>Sir Waldo could have enlightened him, but thought it more tactful to refrain from divulging that he figured in his eccentric relative's Will as &#x2018;the only member of my family who has paid no more heed to me than I have to him.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, for my part I think it very unsatisfactory,' said Lady Lindeth. &#x2018;And not at all what poor Cousin Joseph would have wished!'</p> <p>&#x2018;You do mean to do that, Waldo?' Julian asked.</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, I think so, if I find the place at all suitable. It may not be and in any event I don't want it prattled about, so just you keep your tongue, young man!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, of all the abominable injustices ! I didn't prattle about your horrid brats: it was George! Waldo, if you mean to go north, may I go with you?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Why, yes, if you wish, but you'll find it a dead bore, you know.

All of the surfaces &#x2014; the pale wood table, the backs and arms of both chairs, the long low cabinet of shallow drawers &#x2014; hummed with a shimmer of honeyed dust.

Between herself and the boy there were sheets of unmarked paper, some coloured, some plain, and near them a wooden box filled with pencils, chalks and crayons.<br><br>'There's plenty of paper here,' Alice said. 'You could draw something. Make me a picture.'<br><br>Barely a flicker of response in those eyes.<br><br>'It's difficult, isn't it?' Alice said.

Now, says theologian Roger Olson, postconservatism is moving beyond conventional battles against liberalism and heresy to posit a dynamic and realistic approach. While conservatives strive to preserve tradition and protect orthodoxy, postconservatives urge openness to doctrinal reform without abandoning orthodoxy. Where differences exist between doctrine and Scripture, doctrine must be brought into conformity with the Word. Postconservatives want to free evangelical theology from its paradoxical captivity to rationalism and its obsession with &#34;facts&#34; so that it may recognize truth in experience and personal knowledge. Theologians, pastors, seminarians, and serious thinkers will find many depths to plumb in this exhaustive survey of critics, advocates, and fellow travelers on the evangelical journey.</p><p><i>Reformed and Always Reforming</i> is part of the Acadia Studies in Bible and Theology series. Series editors are Craig A. Evans and Lee Martin McDonald.<br><br><b>Can we be more evangelical by being less conservative?<br></b><br>"In his new book, Olson sets forth a genuinely evangelical theology that rejects modernity and fundamentalism. His focus on a personal relationship with Christ over propositions and the need to continually revise theology in light of the Word of God are important corrections to conservative evangelical tendencies. Anyone interested in a truly gospel-oriented theology will benefit from engaging with his arguments."<br>--<b>Alan G. Padgett</b>, Luther Seminary, editor of the <i>Journal for Christian Theological Research</i> (www.jctr.org)<br><br>"'Evangelicalism' has been described as a set of corrective theological emphases. Roger Olson describes how among postconservative evangelicals such an impulse for reform has continued right up to the present. Privileging a style that is open and generous, these theologians have valued transformation over information and have put narrative before proposition. One can only applaud."<br>--<b>Robert K. Johnston</b>, Fuller Seminary, coeditor of <i>The Variety of American Evangelicalism<br><br></i>"Roger Olson's newest book provides an excellent overview of the recent (and ongoing) methodological and material debates among 'evangelical' theologians. Olson not only explains the historical and political issues that contributed to the current situation in evangelical theology, he also offers resources for a 'postconservative' approach to theology that always maintains its commitment to the ongoing reformation of the church and its proclamation of the gospel."<br>--<b>F. LeRon Shults</b>, Agder University (Norway), coauthor of <i>Transforming Spirituality<br><br></i>"In this book Olson provides a description and critical assessment of the developments related to the postconservative style of thinking along with a robust defense of its principles and intuitions in response to its more conservative critics. Anyone looking for a clear and authoritative overview of the current trajectories and future possibilities of this approach to evangelical theology would be well advised to start here."<br>--<b>John R. Franke</b>, Biblical Seminary<br><br>"'Postconservative theology' sees itself as holding on to evangelicalism's theological heart but shedding its modern baggage and reactionary tendencies. Roger Olson's 'apologia' sketches the lines of influence and distinction between conservative and postconservative evangelical theology and pleads for his side's ways of reflecting on the Christian faith. Whether or not you agree with the movement or even the label, the thinkers he cites in these pages are a serious force worthy of respectful engagement."<br>--<b>Telford Work</b>, Westmont College<b>Roger E.

Raising his namesake Hampton Legion of soldiers, he eventually became a lieutenant general of Confederate cavalry after the death of the legendary J. E. B. Stuart. Hampton&#x2019;s highly capable, but largely unheralded, military leadership has long needed a modern treatment. After the war, Hampton returned to South Carolina, where chaos and violence reigned as Northern carpetbaggers, newly freed slaves, and disenfranchised white Southerners battled for political control of the devastated economy. As Reconstruction collapsed, Hampton was elected governor in the contested election of 1876 in which both the governorship of South Carolina and the American presidency hung in the balance. While aspects of Hampton&#x2019;s rise to power remain controversial, under his leadership stability returned to state government and rampant corruption was brought under control. Hampton then served in the U.S. Senate from 1879 to 1891, eventually losing his seat to a henchman of notorious South Carolina governor "Pitchfork" Ben Tillman, whose blatantly segregationist grassroots politics would supplant Hampton&#x2019;s genteel paternalism. In <i>Wade Hampton</i>, Walter Brian Cisco provides a comprehensively researched, highly readable, and long-overdue treatment of a man whose military and political careers had a significant impact upon not only South Carolina, but America. Focusing on all aspects of Hampton&#x2019;s life, Cisco has written the definitive military-political overview of this fascinating man. <b>Winner of the 2006 Douglas Southall Freeman Award</b>.</p><p>Walter Brian Cisco is the author of <i>States Rights Gist: A South Carolina General of the Civil War</i>, an alternative selection of the History Book Club, and <i>Taking a Stand: Portraits from the Southern Secession Movement</i>.

In this case, he writes a picaresque saga that will dismay those who know Groom is capable of better stuff. This book opens on a down-and-out, disillusioned Gump, his "srimp" business "ruint" and his mama dead. Soon Jenny, his lifelong love, dies too-only to reappear as an advice-giving spirit when Gump needs her most. Gump begins a search for a job with which to support little Forrest, who is seven when the book begins (though Gump says 10 years have passed) and already savvier than his "idiot" father. Gump embarks on a series of farcical adventures that always culminate either with him fleeing an angry mob or "thowed" in jail. Along the way, he tries to find a new formula to save the "CokeCola" company; works for a pig farmer; sells bogus encyclopedias; and gets involved with Oliver North, who uses him in the arms-for-hostage negotiations with Iran. He meets a dotty President Reagan, a venal Rev. Jim Bakker and a financier named Ivan Bozosky. Gump encounters Tom Hanks and others at Elaine's restaurant; provokes the destruction of the Berlin Wall; captures Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War, only to be directed by General "Scheisskopf" to let him loose. Coincidences and pratfalls occur at a dizzying rate. Constantly "shoveling shit" as fast as he can, Gump learns "don't never let nobody make a movie of your life's story." He gets that one right.

Situated somewhere between the grotesque and the classical, Dix&#x2019;s harsh, unrelenting realism produced some of the most horrific depictions of the First World War, and some of the most critical portrayals of the Weimar Republic. Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Kunstmuseum in Stuttgart, <i>Otto Dix and New Objectivity</i> is the first publication to fully illuminate the Neue Sachlichkeit against the backdrop of the Weimar Republic and National Socialism. The exhibition brings together around 120 works to investigate what characterizes the New Objectivity and how variously the term has been used and interpreted since the 1920s. Some of Dix&#x2019;s key works--including the &#x201c;Metropolis&#x201d; triptych (1928&#x2013;29), the great psychological portraits and the landscapes with their hidden symbolism painted during the years Dix spent at Lake Constance--form the departure point for this exploration of his oeuvre. They are placed in context alongside the works of George Grosz, Franz Lenk, Werner Peiner, Franz Radziwill, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Georg Scholz, creating a new perspective on this crucial chapter in German art history and illuminating these artists&#x2019; various reactions to the National Socialist aesthetic and art policy.</p><p></p><h2>In Christ Jesus (Hodder Christian Paperbacks)</h2><p>In this new revised edition of the classic 'In Christ Jesus' Colin Urquhart explains clearly what it means to be in Christ Jesus.

Born into a humble tradesman's family, this adaptable genius rose to become an architect of the world's first democracy, a leading light in Enlightenment science, and a major creator of what has come to be known as the American character.

By the middle of 1757, however, he had become famous in Pennsylvania as a public-spirited citizen and a soldier; well-known throughout America as a writer, politician, and the most important theorist of the American empire; and renowned in the western world as a natural philosopher. This volume tells the story of that transformation.</p><p>In late 1747, Britain's war with Spain and France had been under way since 1741 and 1744, respectively. French and Spanish ships were raiding up and down the Atlantic coast of the colonies and even in the Delaware Bay. With an organized force of less than several hundred, enemy troops could have plundered the entire city of Philadelphia. The Pennsylvania Assembly, dominated by the Quaker Party, refused to provide defense. Franklin proposed a volunteer militia, aroused the public, and raised more than ten thousand volunteer troops in Pennsylvania. He organized a successful lottery that raised funds to buy cannon and build fortifications to defend Philadelphia. When peace was proclaimed in August 1748, he was the most popular person in Pennsylvania.</p><p>During the same period, Franklin devoted whatever time he could spare to electricity. News concerning its inexplicable marvels had appeared in popular magazines in 1745. In 1746 European electrical experimenters created the Leyden jar, an early capacitor. It could build up and store an electric charge that would be released when the inside and outside of the bottle were connected. Its effects were astonishing. Two hundred Swiss guards, with hands joined, would all be shocked and jump instantaneously upon receiving the electric charge. No one understood how the Leyden jar worked. Franklin offered the first good explanation, based partly on the atomic theories of the Greeks. He theorized that electricity was not created; rather, it separated existing elements into positive and negative charges. He also suggested that atmospheric electricity existed; hypothesized that lightning was an electrical discharge; and experimented to test the hypothesis. During the first several years of his electric experiments, English electricians ridiculed him. Then, following Franklin's directions, the French tested and proved correct his theories that clouds could contain electric charges and that lightning was electrical in nature. He quickly became the best-known living natural philosopher, and the Royal Society of London awarded him its Copley medal in 1753&#x2014;the most prestigious existing scientific award, comparable to today's Nobel Prize.</p><p>Franklin was also interested in weather, and like all almanac makers, he wondered if one could go beyond the comments on the seasons and prediction of eclipses. Almost by accident, he tracked the progress of hurricanes and found that although the winds in the great storms blew from the northwest, the storms actually moved up from the southeast. Having established the southeast-to-northwest direction in which the storms moved, he hypothesized why and where they started and why they traveled in a northwest direction. Taking into account the effects of trade winds, the Appalachian Mountains, and the behavior of hot and cold air, his hypotheses were simple, crude, and brilliant. So too were his ruminations on tornadoes, whirlwinds, and waterspouts. They were the best explanations, thought Captain James Cook, that existed. Franklin was America's first scientific weatherman.</p><p>In 1749 Franklin started the Academy and College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania). Franklin's basic idea for the academy was to educate youths from approximately the thirteen to eighteen in ways that would prepare them either for further study or for a career in business. It was a radically different education, which he projected as an alternative to the apprenticeship system and to the existing elite academic schools. The latter taught youths Latin and a little Greek, which were the requirements for entrance into the colleges of the day&#x2014;Harvard, Yale, and William and Mary&#x2014;where one further studied Latin and Greek. The apprenticeship system taught a youth a specific trade, which he then practiced for the remainder of his life. Franklin's Academy of Philadelphia would be primarily an English, mathematical, and agricultural school, with the study of modern languages (French, Spanish, and German) emphasized rather than Latin and Greek. But the major financial contributors to the Academy wanted the traditional curriculum; Latin and Greek at first supplemented and then gradually superseded Franklin's proposed curriculum.</p><p>While the academy was taking shape, Dr. Thomas Bond came to Franklin with a project for starting a hospital "for the Reception and Cure of poor sick Persons." Bond was finding it impossible to interest enough people to contribute funds. Franklin subscribed �25 and wrote "on the Subject in the Newspapers." Despite their joint efforts, the money was insufficient, so Franklin appealed to the legislature. When the proposal ran into trouble there, Franklin came up with the idea of the first matching grant. Partially because the assemblymen doubted that Franklin and Bond would be able to raise the necessary amount, the House unanimously passed the bill on 1 February 1750/1, granting �2,000 if the projectors first raised �2,000 privately. Years later, Franklin wrote: "I do not remember any of my political Manoeuvres, the Success of which gave me at the time more Pleasure. Or that in after-thinking of it, I more easily excus'd myself for having made some Use of Cunning" (A 123).</p><p>Although Franklin planned to add a college to the academy, when the Academy and College of Philadelphia was officially chartered in 1754, it featured, to Franklin's chagrin, the traditional subjects. It was even in danger of becoming primarily a school for ministers, like Harvard and Yale. It remained nonsectarian, however, and within a few years two medical students, whom Franklin had encouraged, started a medical school. That began the transformation of the Academy and College of Philadelphia into a university. The medical school offered superior training, partly because of the Pennsylvania Hospital. In it, the students could attend the doctors on their rounds of the patients and learn about various illnesses and possible remedies. The first medical school in the colonies, it featured empirical training comparable to the best anywhere in the world.</p><p>In imitation of the Union Fire Company (which Franklin had started in 1736), six other fire companies were founded in Philadelphia, and by 1751 they met together quarterly to practice fire fighting. That year, Franklin used these companies as a base for projecting an insurance company against loss by fire. Franklin served as its president for two years, but after it became successful and financially sound, he left it to its fortune.</p><p>While increasingly more of a national and international figure because of his improvements to the common stove and especially because of his electrical experiments, Franklin also took a greater interest in politics. Like numerous Americans, he was irritated by English condescension to Americans and by the English assumption of superiority. In the spring of 1751, his frequent rumblings of discontent with English attitudes erupted. England's dumping of felons into the American colonies, and the Board of Trade's sneering comment that transporting felons provided for "the better peopling of America," outraged him. In the most furious attack on the English authorities before the Stamp Act, Franklin compared the British transporting of criminals to dumping toilets on the dining tables of Americans. "Jakes on our Tables!" became the first widely reprinted editorial in American journalism. A month later, May 1751, Franklin reinforced his news reports and editorial with a savage satire, "Rattlesnakes for Felons," which proposed sending rattlesnakes to England as a suitable return for the English criminals.</p><p>Earlier that year, in January 1751, Franklin had proposed a plan for the union of the colonies. The farsighted proposal became a blueprint for Franklin's Albany Plan of 1754. Before the end of 1751, Franklin drafted the fundamental document of the American Revolution, "Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Cities, etc." It showed that within every twenty-five years, America's population doubled, whereas England's and Europe's population would not double in five hundred years. Thus, within a century, America's population would be larger than England's, and if the colonies remained within the British empire, an American city would likely become the empire's capital. "Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind" circulated widely in manuscript in England and America, but it was not published until 1755. All the major revolutionaries&#x2014;Washington, Jefferson, Adams, and so on&#x2014;knew "Observations," and all of them, in part because Franklin had proven it, believed in the future greatness of America. As the most significant study of the influence of the frontier on American history, "Observations" influenced not only the future American rebellion but also the succeeding intellectual achievements of Richard Price, Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, Charles Darwin, and Frederick Jackson Turner.</p><p>Franklin officially entered politics in his annus mirabilis, 1751. Though he had been clerk of the Pennsylvania Assembly since 1736, and though he had&#x2014;as a writer, reporter, and editor&#x2014;influenced votes and elections ever since his <i>Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency</i> (1729), he himself had no vote in the assembly. But in May 1751, after the death of a Philadelphia representative, he was elected to the Pennsylvania House. He quickly became its most active assemblyman, serving on more committees than anyone and writing the reports for the committees on which he served.</p><p>Though Governor James Hamilton and other Proprietary Party members hoped that Franklin might join them, the Proprietary Party tended to believe more in social hierarchy, in the privileges of the elite, and in the authority of the proprietors and of Great Britain than did the Quaker or Popular Party. In one area, defense, Franklin agreed with the Proprietary Party. He thought Pennsylvania should support troops for its defense on the Pennsylvania frontier and the Delaware Bay and should even contribute to colonial military expeditions like the one to Cape Breton in 1745. But in all other ways, Franklin's views were closer to those of the Quaker Party. The Proprietary Party could be regarded as Pennsylvania's version of England's Tory Party, and the Quaker Party as Pennsylvania's Whigs. Franklin was a radical egalitarian all his life. Not all Quaker Party members were Quakers, but many were, and some were pacifists. Nevertheless, he identified with the Quaker Party and immediately became its leader. The moderate Quaker Isaac Norris remained in the most powerful position in the Pennsylvania Assembly, Speaker, but Franklin became the Quaker Party's driving force.</p><p>In Franklin's first assembly session (which was the third and last for the assembly of 1750-51), Speaker Norris assigned him to a committee that focused on the expense entailed in conducting Indian affairs; as they had become increasingly expensive; the proprietors, who were the primary beneficiaries of the treaties, refused to bear any of the cost. For the assembly, Franklin wrote a message reminding Governor James Hamilton that the assembly had previously asked whether the proprietors would not contribute part of the expense of Indian treaties. Hamilton replied that the proprietors did not intend to pay for any part of the expenses and that they would prefer not to hear again about the matter. Franklin promptly drafted a series of resolves blasting the proprietors for their parsimony, unfairness, and arrogance. The assembly unanimously approved the resolves on 22 August 1751. It should have become clear at that time to anyone who was aware of the assembly's actions that Franklin had become a Quaker Party leader.</p><p>The chief proprietor of the Proprietary Colony of Pennsylvania, Thomas Penn, had resolved to raise all the money for himself that he could. He did so primarily by controlling the land: he sold land at a high price to Pennsylvania settlers and charged them a comparatively small quitrent thereafter. Though his grandfather William Penn had been given the land by King Charles II, William Penn had also bought the land that would be settled from the Indians. He then sold land to the colonists at a profit. Thomas Penn continued that practice but took greater advantage of the Indians and the colonists.</p><p>Believing that the Pennsylvania Assembly was becoming too powerful, Thomas Penn decided that he or his primary deputy, the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania (in practice, the lieutenant governor in Pennsylvania was called the governor), would control the funds the assembly raised. Further, Penn forbade the governor to pass any act of assembly that taxed his estate in Pennsylvania. Penn demanded a �5,000 bond from his governors to observe the secret instructions.</p><p>Though Franklin had retired as a printer at the beginning of 1748, he remained active in selecting the contents of the <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>, and he annually compiled <i>Poor Richard's Almanac</i>. His income as postmaster of Philadelphia and comptroller of the postal service in America supplemented his income from his printing partnership. As comptroller, he improved the routines, routes, and schedules of the post office by traveling north to New England in the late summer of 1753. Because of his electrical experiments, he was granted an honorary master of arts degree by Harvard and then by Yale. Later in 1753, he was appointed joint deputy postmaster general of the American post office. He had previously, as postmaster of Philadelphia and then as comptroller of the American post office, designed a short and simple post office form that systemized postal accounting, and now he determined to improve the frequency and the geographical extent of the postal system. The American post office had never been profitable, but Franklin made it so.</p><p>In the early 1750s, the French began to build a series of forts from Lake Erie down the Allegheny River to present-day Pittsburgh. They claimed the land from the Great Lakes to the Ohio River and from it to the Mississippi River and to New Orleans. The French and the English colonists carried on an unofficial war, mainly on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains. While the colonists unofficially fought the French, the individual colonies competed with one another. Thus the Ohio Company of Virginia set up a post at what became Pittsburgh and indirectly claimed that part of Pennsylvania as its own. On 17 April 1754, a large French force ousted the small party of Virginians at that location and set up Fort Duquesne. Strategically, it was the key to the Ohio Valley and to the rivers that flowed from the northeast into the Mississippi. Encouraged by the French, Indians who were allied with th...</p></p><h2>Auntie Claus and the Key to Christmas</h2><p>It's getting toward Christmas at the Bing Cherry Hotel, and Auntie Claus is preparing for her annual "business trip." Just before she is ready to leave, her favorite nephew, Christopher Kringle, begins to have doubts about the family business. To settle the matter, Auntie Claus summons Chris for tea, but like any self-respecting Kringle, Chris decides to take matters into his own hands: He plans to get on the Bad-Boys-and-Girls List on purpose! Even after his older sister, Sophie, reveals that their great-aunt, Auntie Claus, is really Santa's sister, Chris needs to see for himself, in order to believe.<br> In this companion to the much loved <i>Auntie Claus</i>, come along on a magical journey with Sophie Kringle's little brother, Chris, to a place you may have seen only in your dreams. And discover that <i>anything</i> is possible, when you have the key to Christmas!<br></p><p>The companion book to Elise Primavera's much-celebrated <i>Auntie Claus</i>, <i>Auntie Claus and the Key to Christmas</i>, gives Sophie Kringle's younger brother, Christopher, a turn in the starring role. Finally, Chris will learn the Kringle family secret--that his great-aunt Auntie Claus, inhabitant of penthouse 25C of New York City's Bing Cherry Hotel, is Santa Claus's older sister! When Chris overhears someone say that only babies believe in Santa Claus--and then repeats the rumor!--he is immediately summoned by Auntie Claus for tea, marmalade cake, and a talking-to. During teatime he learns of the PRUNES--Parade Rainers United National Elite Society (people who would dare to say there's no Santa) as well as the B-B-and-G List (Bad-Boys-and-Girls) that Santa makes each year. Taking it all with a grain of salt, Chris decides to use the scientific method: he'll behave so boorishly that he'll get on the List--if he still gets presents, he'll know it's all a hoax. Sophie attempts to demystify Christmas for him once and for all, sending him up in a magical elevator to the North Pole where he discovers (1) he made the List, (2) PRUNES exist, and (3) Santa exists. Sharing some of the smart-alecky humor of Jon Scieszka's Time Warp Trio series (Ozzie and Pam Spam are on tour promoting their new book <i>We're Geniuses and Yer Not!</i>, for instance), Auntie Claus then dashes the comparison with a sweet-as-cherry-pie maxim--"the best things are invisible"--which also happens to be the key to Christmas.

Although some Gnostic beliefs are close to mainstream Christianity, others examined here include that the world is imperfect because it was created by an evil god who was constantly at war with the true, good God; that Christ and Satan were brothers; that reincarnation exists; and that women are the equal of men.

The author, a niece of Rider Haggard, herself travelled on the fringe of art and literary circles in Europe and the United States, and she became Chagall's mistress in 1945. Through her text, the reader is able to experience some of the intimate encounters of artists with other artists; Picasso, for example, was obviously hero and adversary for Chagall. This partial biography is a good account of Chagall the man and the artist, and the author never drops celebrated names for the sake of it, nor begs for favor from the reader; she is fair and factual in telling her story.

By the time of his death on January 3, 2005, Will Eisner was recognized internationally as one of the giants in the field of sequential art, a term he coined. <br> <br> In a career that spanned nearly eight decades&#x2014;from the dawn of the comic book to the advent of digital comics&#x2014;Will Eisner was truly the 'Orson Welles of comics' and the 'father of the Graphic Novel'. He broke new ground in the development of visual narrative and the language of comics and was the creator of The Spirit, John Law, Lady Luck, Mr. Mystic, Uncle Sam, Blackhawk, Sheena and countless others. <br> <br> During World War II, Will Eisner used the comic format to develop training and equipment maintenance manuals for the US Army. After the war this continued as the Army's <em>P.S. Magazine</em>, which is still being produced today. Will Eisner taught Sequential Arts at the New York School of Visual Arts. The textbooks that he wrote based on his course are still bestsellers. In 1978, Will Eisner wrote <em>A Contract with God</em>, the first modern graphic novel. This was followed by almost 20 additional graphic novels over the following 25 years. <br> <br> The "Oscars" of the Comic Industry are called The Eisner Awards, and named after Will Eisner. The Eisners are presented annually before a packed ballroom at Comic-Con International in San Diego, America's largest comics convention. <br> <br> <em>Wizard</em> magazine named Eisner "the most influential comic artist of all time." Michael Chabon's Pulitzer-prize winning novel <em>The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</em> is based in good part on Eisner. In 2002, Eisner received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Federation for Jewish Culture, only the second such honor in the organization's history, presented by Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Art Spiegelman.Structured around the induction of a young man much like himself into the army in 1942, Eisner's ( A Life Force ) autobiographical graphic novel examines the lives of Jewish immigrants and their children in pre-WW II Europe and America. As young Willie's troop train heads south, his window is transformed into a view of his family's past, full of the suffering and blunt anti-Semitism that characterized the times. Willie relives the death of his mother's father, who had immigrated to America in 1880, and the dispersal of her family among relatives and strangers. Willie's father--an aspiring artist in old Vienna--comes to the U.S. after the outbreak of the first world war to become a small-time businessman. Eisner's story is appealing but marred by schmaltzy confrontations and melodramatic graphics. He excels at recreating the family's daily struggle to survive, yet his characters and situations incline toward stereotype and his depictions of emotions--tearful eyes raised to heaven in joy or archly furrowed brows at the delivery of bad news--border on cliche. A vivid but flawed work from an acknowledged master of the comics medium. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Last American Man</h2><p>The Last American Man</p><p></p><h2>Fates Worse/death Ltd</h2><p><p>The author offers a collection of essays and speeches discussing the future of Earth, neoconservatism, Alcoholics Anonymous, liturgical music, and other topics, and includes autobiographical commentary on ten years of his own life.</p><p></p></p><p>While a young PR man at General Electric, KURT VONNEGUT (1922-2007) sold his first short story to one of the many literary publications that were thriving then.

DAVIDSON's career spans all venues of the acting business: theatre, film, and narration.Return of the Old Rambler, doing a replay on his 1981 autobiographical collage Palm Sunday, this time pasting together a memoir from speeches, forewords, articles, and so on written since 1981. Norman Mailer invented this format with Advertisements for Myself (1959) and no one, including Mailer, has done it as well since. Vonnegut adds plenty of humor to his new model but not much sinew. There's something truly self-defeating about parenthetical asides that leave each page of copy slack with interruptions. He includes vague forewords to Franklin Library editions of his more recent novels; writes of his brushes with Salman Rushdie (who, despite a friendship with Vonnegut, shot down one of his novels, with Vonnegut seriously thinking of adding another team to the hit list on Rushdie); comments on the firebombing of Dresden; recalls dead friends who appeared in Slaughterhouse-Five and dead fellow novelists Nelson Algren, Donald Barthelme, Hemingway, James Jones, Irwin Shaw, and others; and discusses his own incompetence as a speech-writer, his dislike of or inability to read his own works, and a suicide attempt that was foiled by a stomach pump. Vonnegut pictures himself as a depressive, though his less-than-faint hope for humanity is not as corroded as Mark Twain's during his later years. Vonnegut's most well-developed theme is in the title, as he weighs fates worse than death, including crucifixion (enslavement by the Reverend Jim Jones of the Guyana Kool-Aid horror doesn't measure up). His most memorable moments are about his first wife Jane and her death from cancer; his architect father, who never got a chance to show his stuff; and his deep feelings for fellow Dresden POW Bernard V. O'Hare. Vonnegut writes best about people, while his think pieces are sliced up with asides or dry-gulched by his alter ego. Patchy. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The unerathing in today's Iraq (in 1879) of a clay cylinder-shaped decree from Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid dynasty of Persia, stands in the same traditin of game changing discoveries from antiquity as Hammurabi's famous law code or the intact tom of the boy-king Tutankhamun. For the Cyrus Cylinder contains in microcosm the whole history of its period. Inscribed with an account of the conquest of Babylon in 539 BC by the Persian king, it records an event which launched one of the greatest imperial adventures in history. It describes Cyrus' capture and deposition of Nabondius, last native Babylonian ruler (represented by the Cylinder text as an oppressor of his own people), and proclaims the Persian, aided by the god Marduk, as a liberator. His annexation of Babylon was to become the platform upon which the Achaemenid military machine built its later vast imperium. But the Cylinder is more than an ancient exercise in propaganda.<br>It has been celebrated as the world's first declaration of human rights, and an international symbl of religious tolerance, setting out the decree from which Cyrus freed the Jews in Babylon : an event recorded by Isaiah. Few other objects from antiquity are invested with so many hopes for the future. This important volume is the first to discuss the Cylinder and its remarkable history. Written by internationally respected authorities from the British Museum, it offers a fresh consideration of its subject in the light of new discoveries. Included here is a complete new translation of the Cylinder inscription using recently identified but previously unpublished sources. Archive materials have allowed a fresh investigation of the circumstances of the original nineteenth-century find by Hormuzd Rassam, and a reappraisal of the mysterious 'Chinese bone' forgeries. The book also discusses the extraordinary and evolving history of Cyrus' timeless message: a message that continues powerfully to resonate.</p></p><p>I L Finkel is Assistant Keeper of Ancient Mesopotamian Script, Languages and Cultures in the Department of the Middle East at the British Museum. He is co-author (with M J Seymour) of Babylon: Myth and Reality (2008), and editor of Ancient Board Games in Perspective (2007).""The Cyrus Cylinder is one of the most important records of antiquity, from the greatest of the near eastern empires: the Achaemenid Persian. The Cylinder is fascinating for the story of its discovery, its reconstruction and later history, even its forgery on Chinese bone. This presentation of it by several experts, fully illustrated and in color, offers a great deal for any reader engaged by how we reconstruct antiquity, as well as for dedicated scholars."" - Sir John Boardman, FBA, Emeritus Lincoln Professor of Classical Art and Archaeology, University of Oxford<br>""The Cyrus Cylinder represents a very significant addition to existing studies of this iconic object, which only seems to grow in stature with the passage of time. With reference to Irving Finkel's observations, it is of great interest to learn that the text existed in more than one format. That is to say that two newly identified fragments from a conventional tablet show that Cyrus' exceptional message was not only written on barrel-shaped cylinders that were intended for interment in the foundations of major structures, but that it was also written on large flat tablets that were very possibly intended for public display. In line with certain statements in the Book of Ezra, this finding could also lend new authority to a supposition that Cyrus issued separate proclamations addressed to separate components of the population of Babylon."" &#x2013; David Stronach, OBE, Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern Archaeology, University of California, Berkeley <p></p>'Few ancient testimonies have had as fascinating a history or as controversial an interpretation as Cyrus's building inscription from Babylon. The more it is used as a historical source and/or a political tool, the more grateful we are not only to have an edition of the text based on state-of-the-art research but also reliable information on the historical background of Cyrus's message and on the history of the artefact itself.'- Josef Wieseh�fer, Professor of Ancient History, Kiel University<br><p></p></p><h2>Aimee Crocker&#39;s Refined Vaudeville</h2><p>Aimee Crocker, America&#39;s most intriguing, entertaining and controversial heiress was born during the Civil War and made headlines around the world from the dawn of the Gilded Age until she died in 1941. She was the daughter of tycoon E.B. Crocker and niece of Charles Crocker, who, together with Collis Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Leland Stanford built the western half of the Transcontinental Railroad, the greatest transportation line the world had ever built. According to K. M. Taylor, author of the soon-to-be-released Aimee Crocker s Refined Vaudeville: Around the World with America s Most Intriguing Heiress it was this monumental achievement living inside Aimee Crocker that afforded her a life of bold risk-taking. Crocker was known from San Francisco and New York, to London, Paris and Tokyo for her extravagant parties, her decade of hair-raising adventures while living in the mysterious Far East, and for her collection of husbands, adopted children, snakes, pearls, Buddhas and tattoos. Crocker was given two official titles: Princess Palaikalani Bliss of Heaven by King David Kalakaua when he gave her one of his Hawaiian islands, and Princess Galitzine the day that she married her fifth and final husband when she was 61 and he was 26. Aimee Crocker s Refined Vaudeville contains highlights, in Aimee s own words, of a harrowing honeymoon train crash in California, a blood-curdling escape down a jungle river, an abduction by a Dyak prince, a poisoning in Hong Kong, a murder attempt by knife-throwing servants in Shanghai, three weeks in the harem of Bhurlana, a search for Kaivalya (Liberation) at the cave of the Great Yogin Bhojaveda in Poona, and two bizarre sensual experiences, one with an Indian boa constrictor and another with a Chinese violin in the house of the ivory panels. Crocker, the world&#39;s first celebutante, was known also for her relationships with actors, painters, literary figures, princes, a king, a maharaja, a chieftain, a Bowery Underworld figure, a legendary occultist, and more than one opera singer. She was a jet setter before there were jets, a great entertainer before there was a movie industry, and a liberated woman before the 19th Amendment. She was, in Taylor&#39;s words, both completely of her time, a product of headstrong genetics, a boisterous environment, and a Gilded Age in western civilization, and far ahead of her time an individualized, free-thinking, self-created, citizen of the world.</p><p>Kevin Taylor is a researcher, screenwriter, former journalist &amp; teacher, and a photographer for the entertainment industry.

Olga Slavnikova&#x2019;s <i>The Man Who Couldn&#x2019;t Die</i> tells the story of how two women try to prolong a life&#x2015;and the means and meaning of their own lives&#x2015;by creating a world that doesn&#x2019;t change, a Soviet Union that never crumbled.<br><br>After her stepfather&#x2019;s stroke, Marina hangs Brezhnev&#x2019;s portrait on the wall, edits the Pravda articles read to him, and uses her media connections to cobble together entire newscasts of events that never happened. Meanwhile, her mother, Nina Alexandrovna, can barely navigate the bewildering new world outside, especially in comparison to the blunt reality of her uncommunicative husband. As Marina is caught up in a local election campaign that gets out of hand, Nina discovers that her husband is conspiring as well&#x2015;to kill himself and put an end to the charade. Masterfully translated by Marian Schwartz, <i>The Man Who Couldn&#x2019;t Die</i> is a darkly playful vision of the lost Soviet past and the madness of the post-Soviet world that uses Russia&#x2019;s modern history as a backdrop for an inquiry into larger metaphysical questions.</p><p>Olga Slavnikova was born in 1957 in Sverdlovsk (now Ekaterinburg). She is the author of several award-winning novels, including <i>2017</i>, which won the 2006 Russian Booker prize and was translated into English by Marian Schwartz (2010), and <i>Long Jump</i>, which won the 2018 Yasnaya Polyana Award.<br><br>Marian Schwartz translates Russian contemporary and classic fiction, including Tolstoy&#x2019;s <i>Anna Karenina</i>, and is the principal translator of Nina Berberova.Darkly sardonic . . . . oddly timely, for there are all sorts of understated hints about voter fraud, graft, payoffs, and the endless promises of politicians who have no intention of keeping them. It is also deftly constructed, portraying a world and a cast of characters who are caught between the orderly if drab world of old and the chaos of the 'new rich' in a putative democracy. . . . Slavnikova is a writer American readers will want to have more of. (<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i>)<br><br>Rather than celebrate the crumbling of walls, Slavnikova&#x2019;s novel shows us all the Lenin statues still in place. It portrays a culture chained to old realities, unable to establish a new understanding of itself. This is a funhouse mirror worth looking into, especially in today&#x2019;s United States with its alternative facts, unpoetic assertions, and morbid relationship with the past. (Leeore Schnairsohn <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br><i>The Man Who Couldn&#x2019;t Die</i>, lucidly translated by Marian Schwartz, will resound with American readers. Bristling with voter fraud, fake news, and the cozy top-and-tail of media moguls and politicians, Slavnikova&#x2019;s book is fluent in new language of the damaged reality principle. (Olivia Parkes <i>The Baffler</i>)<br><br><i>The Man Who Couldn&#x2019;t Die</i> is a Gogolian portrait of the Kharitonovs, a Moscow family who 'had not been handed any party favors at capitalism&#x2019;s kiddie party' after the fall of the Soviet Union. (Natasha Randall <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br><i>The Man Who Couldn&#x2019;t Die</i> is an overlooked masterpiece of post-Soviet prose by one of contemporary Russia&#x2019;s most important authors. It reveals how Slavnikova&#x2019;s descriptions (and Schwartz&#x2019;s English equivalent) belong alongside those of Vladimir Nabokov, Iurii Olesha, and Nikolai Gogol as truly revolutionary in Russian prose.

Why don&#x2019;t we have the air conditioning on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s broken,&#x201d; I told her.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, why don&#x2019;t you have your window open?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s stuck closed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then why didn&#x2019;t we take my car? My car&#x2019;s got everything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your car is red and flashy. People notice it and remember it. This is the stealth car,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>Lula shifted in her seat. &#x201c;Stealth car, my big toe. This thing is a hunk of junk.&#x201d;<br><br>This was true, but it was my hunk of junk, and due to a professional dry spell it was all I could afford. Lula and I work for my cousin Vinnie&#x2019;s bail bonds office in Trenton, New Jersey. I&#x2019;m a fugitive apprehension agent, and Lula is my sometimes partner.<br><br>We were currently parked on Stark Street, doing surveillance on a rooming house, hoping to catch Melvin Barrel coming or going. He&#x2019;d been accused of possession with intent to sell, Vinnie bonded him out of jail, and Barrel hadn&#x2019;t shown for his court date. Lula makes a wage as the office file clerk, but I only make money if I catch skips, so I was motivated to tough it out in my hellishly hot car, hoping for a shot at snagging Barrel.<br><br>&#x201c;I worked this street when I was a &#x2019;ho,&#x201d; Lula said, &#x201c;but I was in a better section. This here block is for losers. No high-class &#x2019;ho would work this block. Darlene Gootch worked this block but it turned out she was killing people as a hobby.&#x201d;<br><br>Lula was fanning herself with a crumpled fast food bag she&#x2019;d found on the floor in the back of my car, and the smell of stale French fries and ketchup wafted out at me.<br><br>&#x201c;You keep waving that bag around and we&#x2019;re going to smell like we work the fry station at Cluck-in-a-Bucket,&#x201d; I said to her.<br><br>&#x201c;I hear you,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s making me hungry, and much as I like the aroma of food grease, I don&#x2019;t want it stuck in my hair, on account of I just had my hair done. I picked out the pi�a colada conditioner so I&#x2019;d smell like a tropical island.&#x201d;<br><br>Lula&#x2019;s hair was fire-engine red today and straightened to the texture of boar bristle. Her brown skin was slick with sweat. Her extra-voluptuous plus-size body was squeezed into a size 2 petite poison-green spandex skirt, and the acres of flesh that constituted her chest overflowed a brilliant yellow spaghetti-strap tank top. At 5'5" she&#x2019;s a couple inches shorter than me. We&#x2019;re about the same age, which puts us in the proximity of thirtysomething. And we&#x2019;re both single.<br><br>My name is Stephanie Plum and I haven&#x2019;t got Lula&#x2019;s body volume or the attitude that goes with it. My attitude goes more toward survival mode. I have shoulder-length curly brown hair, blue eyes almost always enhanced by a swipe of black mascara, decent teeth, a cute nose in the middle of my face, and I can almost always button the top button on my jeans.<br><br>&#x201c;Look at this fool coming at us, walking down the middle of the street,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;What the heck is he doing?&#x201d;<br><br>The fool was a skinny guy dressed in homie clothes. Baggy pants, wifebeater T-shirt, $700 basketball shoes. He was jogging more than walking, and every couple steps he&#x2019;d look over his shoulder and scan the street. He spotted Lula and me, made a course correction, and ran straight for us. He reached my car, grabbed the driver&#x2019;s side door handle and yanked, but nothing happened.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s with that?&#x201d; Lula asked.<br><br>&#x201c;My door&#x2019;s stuck,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It happens when it gets hot.&#x201d;<br><br>The skinny guy had his face pressed to my window, and he was yelling at us.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s he saying?&#x201d; Lula asked. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t make it out, and I&#x2019;m gonna go blind from the sun reflecting on his gold tooth with the diamond chip in it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s saying if I don&#x2019;t open the door, he&#x2019;ll kill me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That don&#x2019;t sound appealing,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;Maybe this is a good time to go get lunch.&#x201d;<br><br>I turned the key in the ignition, and the engine cranked over and died. I turned it again and there was silence. I looked back at the skinny guy and realized he had a gun pointed at me. Not just any old gun either. This gun was big.<br><br>&#x201c;Open your door,&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;Open your damn door.&#x201d;<br><br>Lula had her purse on her lap and was fumbling around in it. &#x201c;I got a gun in here somewhere,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Keep him busy while I find my gun.&#x201d;<br><br>I fidgeted with the door handle on my side so it would look like I was trying to open it. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the plan,&#x201d; I said to Lula. &#x201c;When you find your gun you let me know so I can duck down and you can shoot him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That would be a good plan,&#x201d; Lula said, &#x201c;but I might not have my gun with me. I might have left it home when I changed from my red purse to my yellow purse. You know how I am about the right accessories.&#x201d;<br><br>The guy was really agitated now. He had the gun against my window and his forehead was glued to the gun, like he was sighting for the kill.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe you should open the door and see what he wants,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;Maybe he just feels like going for a ride. In which case he could have this piece of dog doodie car, and I&#x2019;d be happy to take a bus home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hold on,&#x201d; I yelled at the guy. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to open the door.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; he yelled back.<br><br>&#x201c;Hold on!&#x201d;<br><br>I hauled back and rammed the door full force with my shoulder. The door flew open, catching the guy by surprise, the gun discharged, and he went down to the ground and didn&#x2019;t move.<br><br>We got out of the car and stared down at the guy. He was statue-still and bleeding from his forehead.<br><br>&#x201c;You killed him,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;You hit him with the door, and he shot hisself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was an accident.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t matter. You killed him all the same.&#x201d; Lula toed him, but he still didn&#x2019;t move. &#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br><br>I looked at my car and realized a bullet was embedded in the roof, just over the window. I bent down and took a closer look at the skinny guy.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not shot,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He got hit in the head when the gun kicked back. He&#x2019;s just knocked out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hunh,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;That would have been my second theory.&#x201d;<br><br>We dragged him to the gutter so he wouldn&#x2019;t get run over and we got back into my car. I tried the key, but there was no response.<br><br>&#x201c;I bet your battery&#x2019;s no good,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my professional opinion. You&#x2019;re gonna have to call someone to juice up your battery. And in the meantime I&#x2019;m going across the street to that sad-ass grocery store to get a soda. I&#x2019;m all dehydrated.&#x201d;<br><br>I crossed the street with Lula, we got sodas, and we stood in front of the store chugging them down. A black Cadillac Escalade rolled down the street and stopped by my car. Two idiots wearing gang colors got out, scooped the skinny guy up, and threw him into the Escalade. A yellow Hummer careened around the corner, jerked to a stop half a block in front of the Escalade, and two guys in the Hummer leaned out the window and opened fire. The Escalade returned fire. A guy wearing a crooked ball cap popped his head out of the sunroof on the Hummer, aimed a rocket launcher at the Escalade, and phoonf! the rocket went wide of the Escalade and blew up my car. There was a moment of silence, then both cars roared away.<br><br>Lula and I stared wide-eyed and openmouthed at the fireball consuming my car.<br><br>&#x201c;Jeez Louise,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, but you gotta look on the positive side,&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to worry about charging up the battery.&#x201d;<br><br>Lula&#x2019;s comment might have seemed casual considering the gravity of the situation, but truth is this wasn&#x2019;t the first time someone had exploded my car.<br><br>My cellphone rang, and I knew from the ringtone it was Ranger.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re off the grid,&#x201d; Ranger said when I answered.<br><br>&#x201c;Someone blew up my car.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a moment of silence. &#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess I could use a ride.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Babe,&#x201d; Ranger said. And he disconnected.<br><br>&#x201c;He coming for us?&#x201d; Lula asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;<br><br>Ranger is Latino and former Special Forces turned semi-legitimate businessman. He&#x2019;s part owner of a security firm located in an inconspicuous seven-story building in the center of the city. I work for him on occasion, I&#x2019;ve had one or two romantic skirmishes with him, and he has the sometimes annoying, sometimes convenient habit of installing tracking devices on my vehicles. His hair is dark brown and currently cut short. His eyes are mostly black. His body is perfect from the tip of his toes to the top of his head. He plays by his own rules, and his attitude is uncompromising. He only wears black, and he only drives black cars. He&#x2019;s smart. He&#x2019;s strong in every possible way. And being in his crosshairs is flat out scary.<br><br>No one came out of the little grocery store to look at the fire. No police cars or fire trucks screeched to the scene. It was as if this was business as usual and best ignored.<br><br>I looked down the street at the rooming house, wondering if Melvin Barrel was in there melting down in a pool of sweat. No air conditioners sticking out of any of the windows in the rooming house. For sure no central air.<br><br>&#x201c;I bet that skinny guy you almost killed was running away from someone, and that&#x2019;s why he wanted your car,&#x201d; Lula said.<br><br>I leaned against the building. &#x201c;It was a bad choice of cars.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, but he didn&#x2019;t know that. All&#x2019;s he saw was two women sitting in a car like a couple dummies. He probably figured if we was stupid enough to be sitting in the car, we was stupid enough to give it over to him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was wrong.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not by much,&#x201d; Lula said.<br><br>Fifteen minutes later Ranger eased his black Porsche Cayenne to a stop in front of Lula and me. I got into the front passenger seat, and Lula got into the back.<br><br>Ranger glanced at the charred cadaver of twisted metal and smoldering tires that used to be my car. &#x201c;Yours?&#x201d; he asked me.<br><br>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Do I need to know how this happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br>Ranger idled in front of the bonds office and Lula got out. I moved to follow Lula, and Ranger wrapped his hand around my wrist. &#x201c;Stay. I want to talk to you.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;m not currently in a physical relationship with Ranger. Ranger has clear priorities and matrimony isn&#x2019;t high on the list. In fact, it isn&#x2019;t on the list at all. Until recently marriage hasn&#x2019;t been high on my priorities list either, but my mother feels otherwise, and as much as I hate to admit it my mother is wearing me down.<br><br>&#x201c;I need a date,&#x201d; Ranger said.<br><br>My voice ratcheted up an octave. &#x201c;You want me to get you a date?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. I want you to be my date. I have to attend a black tie event, and I need someone watching my back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t exactly The Terminator.<br><br>&#x201c;People would talk if I brought Tank.&#x201d;<br><br>Tank is appropriately named. He&#x2019;s Ranger&#x2019;s shadow and second in command at Rangeman. And Ranger was right. Tank would make a controversial date.<br><br>&#x201c;When is this?&#x201d; I asked Ranger.<br><br>&#x201c;Tomorrow night.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tomorrow? I can&#x2019;t just drop everything and do this tomorrow. You should have asked me sooner. I&#x2019;m seeing Morelli. It&#x2019;s Friday date night. We&#x2019;re going to the movies and then . . . &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can give you a better and then,&#x201d; Ranger said.<br><br>I went breathless for a beat at the thought of Ranger&#x2019;s and then. Morelli was an amazing lover, but Ranger was magic. I pulled myself together and narrowed my eyes at Ranger, hoping I looked determined.<br><br>&#x201c;You and I are done doing and then with each other,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;There is absolutely no more and then. Morelli and I have an understanding.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which is?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s vague.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Babe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious this time. I might be ready to have a committed adult relationship.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe Morelli is a Trenton cop working plainclothes, crimes against persons. I&#x2019;ve known him forever and our relationship has progressed from downright hostile, to deliciously hot, to maybe we could actually live with each other without complete mayhem. He&#x2019;s six feet of hard muscle and Italian libido. His hair is black and wavy. His eyes are brown and assessing. His style is casual. He wears jeans, untucked shirts, and a Glock 19, and he has a big shaggy dog named Bob.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pay you,&#x201d; Ranger said.<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll hire you for the night. You can be my bodyguard.&#x201d;<br><br>At the risk of sounding mercenary, this got my attention. I was a month behind on my rent, and I wasn&#x2019;t having great luck with the fugitive apprehension stuff. Vinnie had mostly low bond skips this month, and I was barely making pizza money, much less rent money. And I was pretty sure I could muster enough self-control to keep from ripping Ranger&#x2019;s clothes off.<br><br>&#x201c;What exactly would bodyguarding entail?&#x201d; I asked him.<br><br>&#x201c;The usual. You take a bullet for me if necessary, and you manage the small talk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t manage your own small talk?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Making polite conversation isn&#x2019;t at the top of my skill set.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve noticed.&#x201d; Okay, so this doesn&#x2019;t sound so bad, plus I&#x2019;d get dinner, right? &#x201c;What time will you pick me up?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Six o&#x2019;clock. This event is in Atlantic City. Dinner is at eight.&#x201d;<br>TWO<br><br>I left Ranger and joined Lula in the bonds office. The building was brand-new and light-years better than the old office. It had been built on the same footprint as the old office but the walls were freshly painted, the tile on the floor was unscuffed, the furniture was inexpensive but comfortable and free from food and coffee stains.<br><br>Lula had claimed her usual spot on the faux leather couch, and Connie, the office manager, was at her desk. Connie is a couple years older than me, a much better shot, and better connected. Connie&#x2019;s family is old school Italian mob and far more professional than Trenton&#x2019;s gangsta morons when it comes to crime-related skills such as whacking, hijacking, and money laundering. Connie looks a lot like Betty Boop with big hair and a mustache. Today she was wearing a short black pencil skirt, a wide black patent-leather belt, and a tight red sweater with a low scoop neck that showed a lot of her Betty Boopness.</p><h2>Making Sense of Change Management: A Complete Guide to the Models, Tools and Techniques of Organizational Change Management</h2><p>&#34;&#34;In business, either you&#39;re an agent of change, or you&#39;re destined to become a victim of change.&#34;&#34; -- Norm Brodsky in Inc Magazine</p><p>Esther Cameron is an independent consultant, facilitator and senior level coach.

This book traces the origin and development of Chinese pottery and porcelain. The authors describe the artistic features and distinct national style of the life-size statues of warriors and horses in the tomb of the First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C) and the tri-colour glazed pottery of the Tang Dynasty (618-907), as well as other famous works. Stories of celebrated kilns - Ding, Ru, Guan, Ge, Jun and Longquan, their past glory and recovery, are recounted in detail.

Here, they explain the theory's 16 "types," defined by individual preferences within each of four dichotomies--"extraverted"/introverted, sensing/intuitive, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving--and then view the impact of these personality-type similarities and differences on "four keys to a lasting love": communication, sex and intimacy, finance, and conflict. A third section explains how "type talk" can help couples negotiate, establish contracts, and learn to cope with and even to celebrate their similarities and differences, while an appendix supplies brief profiles of the 16 MBTI personality types. The market for advice about relationships seems never to be saturated, and the <i>16 Ways</i> approach, while it may seem a bit mechanical, is more nuanced and complex than many of its pop-psychology competitors. <i>Mary Carroll</i>Kroeger and Thuesen, specialists in the business applications of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), wrote the best-selling Type Talk at Work ( LJ 1/92).

She was black, and as furry as all the world come together to be fur. Meerclar banished the eternal night, and brought forth the two. </p><p>Harar the Goldeneye had eyes as hot and bright as the sun at the Hour of Smaller Shadows; he was the color of daytime, and courage, and dancing. </p><p>Fela Skydancer, his mate, was beautiful, like freedom, and clouds, and the song of travelers returned. </p><p>Goldeneye and Skydancer bore many children and raised them in the forest that covered the world at the beginnings of the Elder Days. Climbfast, Wolf-friend, Treesinger, and Brightnail, their young, were strong of tooth, sharp of eye, light of foot, and straight and brave to their tail-ends. </p><p>But most strange and beautiful of all the countless children of Harar and Fela were the three Firstborn. </p><p>The eldest of the Firstborn was Viror Whitewind; he was the color of sunlight on snow, and of swiftness.... </p><p>The middle child was Grizraz Hearteater, as gray as shadows and full of strangeness.... </p><p>Third-born was Tangaloor Firefoot. He was as black as Meerclar Allmother, but his paws were red like flame. He walked alone, and sang to himself. </p><p>There was rivalry among the Firstborn brothers. Whitewind was as fast and strong as a cat could dream of being&#x2014;none could overmatch him at jumping and running. Firefoot was as clever as time; he solved all puzzles and riddles, and made songs that the Folk sang for generations. </p><p>Hearteater could not match his brothers' exploits. He grew jealous, and began to plot the downfall of Whitewind and the humiliation of the Folk. </p><p>So it came to pass that Hearteater raised up a great beast against the Folk. Ptomalkum was it's name, and it was the last spawn of the demon-hound Venris, whom Meerclar had destroyed in the Days of Fire. Ptomalkum, raised and nurtured with Hearteater's hatred, slew many Folk before it was itself slain by the gallant Whitewind. But Viror Whitewind received such wounds that he soon wasted and died. Seeing the downfall of his schemes, Hearteater was afraid, and crept down a hole and disappeared into the secretive earth. </p><p>There was great lamentation in the Court of Harar at the death of Whitewind, the best-beloved. Firefoot his brother fled the Court in heartache, renouncing his claim to the Mantle of Kingship, and wandered the world. </p><p>Fela Skydancer, Whitewind's mother, was ever after silent, all her long life. </p><p>But Harar Goldeneye was so full of rage that he wept, and swore great oaths. He went howling into the wilderness, destroying all before him in his search for the traitorous Hearteater. Finally, unable to bear such great pain, he fled to the bosom of the Allmother in the sky. There he still lives, chasing the bright mouse of the sun across the heavens. Often he looks down to earth below, hoping to see Viror running once more beneath the trees of the World-Forest. </p><p>Countless seasons turned and the world grew older before Firefoot again met his treacherous brother Hearteater. </p><p>In the days of Prince Cleanwhisker, in the reign of Queen Morningstripe, Lord Tangaloor came to the assistance of the Ruhue, the owl-folk. A mysterious creature had been pillaging their nests, and had killed all the Ruhu hunters who had come against it. </p><p>Firefoot laid a trap, clawing away at a mighty tree until it was near cut through, then lay in wait for the marauder. </p><p>When the creature came that night, and Firefoot felled the tree, he was astonished to discover that beneath it he had trapped Grizraz Hearteater. </p><p>Hearteater begged Firefoot to free him, promising that he would share the ancient lore that he had discovered beneath the ground. Lord Tangaloor only laughed. </p><p>When the sun came up, Hearteater began to scream. He writhed and screeched so that Firefoot, although fearing a trick, liberated his suffering brother from beneath the pinioning tree. </p><p>Hearteater had been so long beneath the earth that the sun was blinding him. He clawed and rubbed at his steaming eyes, howling so piteously that Firefoot looked about for a way to protect him from the burning of the day-star. But when he turned away, the blinded Hearteater dug himself a tunnel, more swiftly than any badger or mole. By the time the startled Firefoot bounded over, Hearteater had disappeared back into the belly of the world. </p><p>It is told that he still lives there, hidden from the eyes of the Folk; that he works foul deeds underground, and aches to return to the World Above.... </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Butterfly Swords</h2><p>***Winner of the Golden Heart Award - Best Historical Romance***<br><br> JOURNEY TO THE EDGE OF HONOR, LOYALTY..AND LOVE<br> <br> During China's infamous Tang Dynasty, a time awash with luxury yet littered with deadly intrigues and fallen royalty, betrayed Princess Ai Li flees before her wedding.Miles from home, with only her delicate butterfly swords for defense, she enlists the reluctant protection of a blue-eyed warrior....<br> <br> Battle-scarred, embittered Ryam has always held his own life at cheap value.

Over themes at times simply too slight to sustain it, he lays a thick veneer, inlayed with intricate imagery and buffed with high-toned diction. At his best he lets a glittering sort of lushness rise from the lines: "a Bible-belt debutante dozing beside me/ into the rich, delta incubus of Sleep." However, at times his metaphors seem strikingly inappropriate, as when he portrays his bachelorhood "pierroting in separateness: / a small cross to carry in such a long/ calvary sic of a life." Too often he serves up incoherence: "Time soaks the fire between you/ and you emerge dripping from the sea, golden/ with the voltage of Life, your palms like bronze gongs clasped."

But it was true that the beach house they usually rented had been sold at the last minute, and the Penderwicks were suddenly without summer plans.

Not that they didn't love Cameron, but what is summer without a trip to somewhere special? Then, out of the blue, Mr. Penderwick heard through a friend of a friend about a cottage in the Berkshire Mountains. It had plenty of bedrooms and a big fenced-in pen for a dog--perfect for big, black, clumsy, lovable Hound Penderwick--and it was available to be rented for three weeks in August. Mr. Penderwick snatched it up, sight unseen.<br>He didn't know what he was getting us into, Batty would say. Rosalind always said, It's too bad Mommy never saw Arundel--she would have loved the gardens. And Jane would say, There are much better gardens in heaven. And Mommy will never have to bump into Mrs. Tifton in heaven, Skye added to make her sisters laugh. And laugh they would, and the talk would move on to other things, until the next time someone remembered Arundel.<br>But all that is in the future. When our story begins, Batty is still only four years old. Rosalind is twelve, Skye eleven, and Jane ten. They're in their car with Mr. Penderwick and Hound. The family is on the way to Arundel and, unfortunately, they're lost.<br>"It's Batty's fault," said Skye.<br>"It is not," said Batty.<br>"Of course it is," said Skye. "We wouldn't be lost if Hound hadn't eaten the map, and Hound wouldn't have eaten the map if you hadn't hidden your sandwich in it."<br>"Maybe it's fate that Hound ate the map. Maybe we'll discover something wonderful while we're lost," said Jane.<br>"We'll discover that when I'm in the backseat for too long with my younger sisters, I go insane and murder them," said Skye.<br>"Steady, troops," said Mr. Penderwick. "Rosalind, how about a game?"<br>"Let's do I Went to the Zoo and I Saw," said Rosalind. "I went to the zoo and I saw an anteater. Jane?"<br>"I went to the zoo and I saw an anteater and a buffalo," said Jane.<br>Batty was between Jane and Skye, so it was her turn next. "I went to the zoo and I saw an anteater, a buffalo, and a cangaroo."<br>"Kangaroo starts with a k, not a c," said Skye.<br>"It does not. It starts with a c, like cat," said Batty.<br>"Just take your turn, Skye," said Rosalind.<br>"There's no point in playing if we don't do it right." <br>Rosalind, who was sitting in the front seat with Mr. Penderwick, turned around and gave Skye her oldest-sister glare. It wouldn't do much, Rosalind knew. After all, Skye was only one year younger than she was. But it might quiet her long enough for Rosalind to concentrate on where they were going. They really were badly lost. This trip should have taken an hour and a half, and already they'd been on the road for three. Rosalind looked over at her father in the driver's seat. His glasses were slipping down his nose and he was humming his favorite Beethoven symphony, the one about spring. Rosalind knew this meant he was thinking about plants--he was a professor of botany--instead of about his driving.<br>"Daddy," she said, "what do you remember about the map?"<br>"We're supposed to go past a little town called Framley, then make a few turns and look for number eleven Stafford Street."<br>"Didn't we see Framley a while ago? And look," she said, pointing out the window. "We've been past those cows before."<br>"Good eyes, Rosy," he said. "But weren't we going in the other direction last time? Maybe this way will do the trick."<br>"No, because all we saw along here were more cow fields, remember?"<br>"Oh, yes." Mr. Penderwick stopped the car, turned it around, and went back the other way.<br>"We need to find someone who can give us directions," said Rosalind.<br>"We need to find a helicopter that can airlift us out of here," said Skye. "And keep your stupid wings to yourself!" She was talking to Batty, who, as always, was wearing her beloved orange-and-black butterfly wings.<br>"They're not stupid," said Batty.<br>"Woof," said Hound from his place among the boxes and suitcases in the very back of the car. He took Batty's side in every discussion.<br>"Lost and weary, the brave explorers and their faithful beast argued among themselves. Only Sabrina Starr remained calm," said Jane. Sabrina Starr was the heroine of books that Jane wrote. She rescued things. In the first book, it was a cricket. Then came Sabrina Starr Rescues a Baby Sparrow, Sabrina Starr Rescues a Turtle, and, most recently, Sabrina Starr Rescues a Groundhog. Rosalind knew that Jane was looking for ideas on what Sabrina should rescue next. Skye had suggested a man-eating crocodile, who would devour the heroine and put an end to the series, but the rest of the family had shouted her down. They enjoyed Jane's books.<br>There was a loud oomph in the backseat. Rosalind glanced around to make sure violence hadn't broken out, but it was only Batty struggling with her car seat--she was trying to twist herself backward to see Hound. Jane was jotting in her favorite blue notebook. So they were both all right. But Skye was blowing out her cheeks and imitating a fish, which meant she was even more bored than Rosalind had feared. They'd better find this cottage soon.<br>Then Rosalind spotted the truck pulled over by the side of the road. "Stop, Daddy! Maybe we can get directions."<br>Mr. Penderwick pulled over and Rosalind got out of the car. She now saw that the truck had TOMATOES painted in large letters on each of its doors. Next to the truck was a wooden table piled high with fat red tomatoes and, behind the table, an old man wearing worn blue jeans and a green shirt with Harry's Tomatoes embroidered across the pocket.<br>"Tomatoes?" he asked.<br>"Ask if they're magic tomatoes," Rosalind heard. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Skye hauling Jane back in through the car window.<br>"My younger sisters," said Rosalind apologetically to the old man.<br>"Had six of 'em myself."<br>Rosalind tried to imagine having six younger sisters, but she kept coming up with each of her sisters turned into twins. She shuddered and said, "Your tomatoes look delicious, but what I really need is directions. We're looking for number eleven Stafford Street."<br>"Arundel?"<br>"I don't know about any Arundel. We're supposed to be renting a cottage at that address."<br>"That's Arundel, Mrs. Tifton's place. Beautiful woman. Snooty as all get-out, too."<br>"Oh, dear."<br>"You'll be fine. There are a couple of nice surprises over there. You're going to have to keep that blond one under control, though," he said, nodding toward the car, where Skye and Jane were now leaning out of the window together, listening. Muffled complaints could be heard from Batty, who was being squashed.<br>"Why me?" called Skye.<br>The man winked at Rosalind. "I can always spot the troublemakers. I was one myself. Now, tell your dad to go down this road a little ways, take the first left, then a quick right, and look for number eleven."<br>"Thank you," said Rosalind, and turned to go.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Seal Team Six (Thorndike Press Large Print Biography)</h2><p>A Navy SEAL Team Six sniper traces the story of how he became an elite soldier while recounting the dramatic mission that nearly cost him his life, offering insider perspectives on his team&#39;s extensive training process at the Marine&#39;s Scout Sniper School. (military history). Book available.</p><p><strong>Product Description</strong><br> <p><i><b>When the Navy sends their elite, they send the SEALs. When the SEALs send their elite, they send SEAL Team Six</b></i></p><p>SEAL Team Six is a secret unit tasked with counterterrorism, hostage rescue, and counterinsurgency. In this dramatic, behind-the-scenes chronicle, Howard Wasdin takes readers deep inside the world of Navy SEALS and Special Forces snipers, beginning with the grueling selection process of Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S)&#x2014;the toughest and longest military training in the world. </p><p>After graduating, Wasdin faced new challenges. First there was combat in Operation Desert Storm as a member of SEAL Team Two. Then the Green Course: the selection process to join the legendary SEAL Team Six, with a curriculum that included practiced land warfare to unarmed combat. More than learning how to pick a lock, they learned how to blow the door off its hinges. Finally as a member of SEAL Team Six he graduated from the most storied and challenging sniper program in the country: The Marine&#x2019;s Scout Sniper School. Eventually, of the 18 snipers in SEAL Team Six, Wasdin became the best&#x2014;which meant one of the best snipers on the planet. </p><p>Less than half a year after sniper school, he was fighting for his life. The mission: capture or kill Somalian warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. From rooftops, helicopters and alleys, Wasdin hunted Aidid and killed his men whenever possible. But everything went quickly to hell when his small band of soldiers found themselves fighting for their lives, cut off from help, and desperately trying to rescue downed comrades during a routine mission. The Battle of Mogadishu, as it become known, left 18 American soldiers dead and 73 wounded. Howard Wasdin had both of his legs nearly blown off while engaging the enemy. His dramatic combat tales combined with inside details of becoming one of the world&#x2019;s deadliest snipers make this one of the most explosive military memoirs in years.</p> <br><br> <br> <b>An Excerpt from <i>SEAL Team Six</i></b> <br> <p><b>Chapter One</b></p> <p><i>Reach Out and Touch Someone</i></p> <p>When the U.S. Navy sends their elite, they send the SEALs. When the SEALs send their elite, they send SEAL Team Six, the navy's equivalent to the army's Delta Force&#x2014;tasked with counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, occasionally working with the CIA. This is the first time a SEAL Team Six sniper's story has been exposed. My story.</p> <p>Snipers avoid exposure. Although we prefer to act rather than be acted upon, some forces are beyond our control. We rely on our strengths to exploit the enemy's vulnerabilities; however, during the war in the Persian Gulf I became vulnerable as the lone person on the fantail of an enemy ship filled with a crew working for Saddam Hussein. On yet another occasion, despite being a master of cover and concealment, I lay naked on an aircraft runway in a Third World country with bullet holes in both legs, the right leg nearly blown off by an AK-47 bullet. Sometimes we must face what we try to avoid.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>In the morning darkness of September 18, 1993, in Mogadishu, Somalia, Casanova and I crept over the ledge of a retaining wall and climbed to the top of a six-story tower. Even at this early hour there were already people moving around. Men, women, and children relieved themselves in the streets. I smelled the morning fires being lit, fueled by dried animal dung and whatever else people could find to burn. The fires heated any food the Somalis had managed to obtain. Warlord Aidid knew fully the power of controlling the food supply. Every time I saw a starving child, I blamed Aidid for his evil power play that facilitated this devastation of life.</p> <p>The tower we were on was located in the middle of the Pakistani compound. The Pakistanis were professional and treated us with great respect. When it was teatime, the boy in charge of serving always brought us a cup. I had even developed a taste for the fresh goat milk they used in the tea. The sounds and scents of the goatherd in the compound reached my senses as Casanova and I crawled onto the outer lip at the top of the tower. There we lay prone, watching a large garage, a vehicle body shop that had no roof. Surrounding the garage was a city of despair. Somalis trudged along with their heads and shoulders lowered. Helplessness dimmed their faces, and starvation pulled the skin tight across their bones. Because this was a "better" part of town, multilevel buildings stood in fairly good repair. There were concrete block houses instead of the tin and wooden lean-to sheds that dominated most of the city and countryside. Nevertheless, the smell of human waste and death&#x2014;mixed with hopelessness&#x2014;filled the air. Yes, hopelessness has a smell. People use the term "developing countries," but that is bullcrap. What developed in Somalia was things such as hunger and fighting. I think "developing countries" is just a term used to make the people who coined it feel better. No matter what you call them, starvation and war are two of the worst events imaginable.</p> <p>I calculated the exact distances to certain buildings. There are two primary considerations when making a sniper shot, windage and elevation. Because there was no significant wind that could throw my shot left or right, I didn't have to compensate for it. Elevation is the variable considered for range/distance to the target. Since most of my potential targets were between 200 yards (garage) and 650 yards (intersection beyond the target garage), I dialed my scope in at 500 yards. This way I could just hold my rifle higher or lower depending on range. When the shooting began, there would be no time to dial in range corrections on my scope between shots.</p> <p>We started our surveillance at 0600. While we waited for our agent to give us the signal, I played different scenarios over in my mind: one enemy popping out at one location, then another popping up at another location, and so on. I would acquire, aim, and even do a simulated trigger pull, going through my rehearsed breathing and follow-through routine while picturing the actual engagement. Then I simulated reloading and getting back into my Leupold 10-power scope, continuing to scan for more booger-eaters. I had done this dry firing and actual firing thousands of times&#x2014;wet, dry, muddy, snowbound, from a dug-in hole in the ground, from an urban sniper hide through a partially open window, and nearly every which way imaginable. The words they had drilled into our heads since we began SEAL training were true, "The more you sweat in peacetime, the less you bleed in war." This particular day, I was charged with making sure none of my Delta Force buddies sprang a leak as I covered their insertion into the garage. My buddies' not bleeding in war was every bit as important as my not bleeding.</p> <p>Our target for this mission was Osman Ali Atto&#x2014;Warlord Aidid's main financier. Although Casanova and I would've been able to recognize the target from our previous surveillance, we were required to have confirmation of his identity from the CIA asset before we gave the launch command.</p> <p>The irony wasn't lost on me that we were capturing Atto instead of killing him&#x2014;despite the fact that he and his boss had killed hundreds of thousands of Somalis. I felt that if we could kill Atto and Aidid, we could stop the fighting, get the food to the people quickly, and go home in one piece.</p> <p>It wasn't until around 0815 that our asset finally gave the predetermined signal. He was doing this because the CIA paid him well. I had learned firsthand while working with the CIA how payoffs could sway loyalty.</p> <p>When we saw the signal, Casanova and I launched the "full package." Little Bird and Black Hawk helicopters filled the sky. During this time, the Delta operators literally had their butts hanging out&#x2014;the urban environment provided too much cover, too much concealment, and too many escape routes for the enemy. All a hostile had to do was shoot a few rounds at a helo or Humvee, jump back inside a building, and put his weapon down. Even if he reappeared, he was not considered hostile without a weapon. Things happened fast, and the environment was unforgiving.</p> <p>Delta Force operators fast-roped down inside the garage, Rangers fast-roped around the garage, and Birds flew overhead with Delta snipers giving the assault force protection. Atto's people scattered like rats. Soon, enemy militia appeared in the neighborhood shooting up at the helicopters.</p> <p>Normally, snipers operate in a spotter-sniper relationship. The spotter identifies, ranges the targets, and relays them to the sniper for execution. There would be no time for that on this op&#x2014;we were engaged in urban warfare. In this environment, an enemy could appear from anywhere. Even worse, the enemy dressed the same as a civilian. We had to wait and see his intention. Even if he appeared with a gun, there was a chance he was part of a clan on our side. We had to wait until the person pointed the weapon in the direction of our guys. Then we would ensure the enemy ceased to exist.</p> <p>There would be no time for makeup or second shots. Both Casanova and I wielded .300 Win Mag sniper rifles.</p> <p>Through my Leupold 10-power scope, I saw a militiaman 500 yards away firing through an open window at the helos. I made a mental note to keep my heart rate down and centered the crosshairs on him as my muscle memory took over&#x2014;stock firmly into the shoulder, cheek positioned behind the scope, eye focused on the center of the crosshairs rather than the enemy, and steady trigger squeezing (even though it was only a light, 2-pound pull). I felt the gratifying recoil of my rifle. The round hit him in the side of the chest, entering his left and exiting his right. He convulsed and buckled, falling backward into the building&#x2014;permanently. I quickly got back into my scope and scanned. Game on now. All other thoughts departed my mind. I was at one with my Win Mag, scanning my sector. Casanova scanned his sector, too.</p> <p>Another militiaman carrying an AK-47 came out a fire escape door on the side of a building 300 yards away from me and aimed his rifle at the Delta operators assaulting the garage. From his position, I'm sure he thought he was safe from the assaulters, and he probably was. He was not safe from me&#x2014;300 yards wasn't even a challenge. I shot him through his left side, and the round exited his right. He slumped down onto the fire escape landing, never knowing what hit him. His AK-47 lay silent next to him. Someone tried to reach out and retrieve the weapon&#x2014;one round from my Win Mag put a stop to that. Each time I made a shot, I immediately forgot about that target and scanned for another.</p> <p>Chaos erupted inside and outside of the garage. People ran everywhere. Little Birds and Black Hawks filled the skies with deafening rotor blasts. I was in my own little world, though. Nothing existed outside my scope and my mission. Let the Unit guys handle their business in the garage. My business was reaching out and touching the enemy.</p> <p>This wasn't the first time I'd killed for my country. It wouldn't be the last.</p> <p>A few minutes passed as I continued scanning. More than 800 yards away, a guy popped up with an RPG launcher on his shoulder, preparing to fire at the helicopters. If I took him out, it would be the longest killing shot of my career. If I failed...</p> Copyright � 2011 by Howard E. Wasdin and Stephen Templin<p></p> <br> <br><p>DR. HOWARD E.

Working title: Bishop Timothy Archer. Main character loosely based on his friend Bishop James Pike. Part of the Valis Trilogy.</p><p>The final book in Philip K. Dick s VALIS trilogy, <i>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</i> brings the author s search for the identity and nature of God to a close. The novel follows Bishop Timothy Archer as he travels to Israel, ostensibly to examine ancient scrolls bearing the words of Christ. But, more importantly, this leads him to examine the decisions he made during his life and how they may have contributed to the suicide of his mistress and son.<br>This introspective book is one of Dick s most philosophical and literary, delving into the mysteries of religion and of faith itself. As one of Dick s final works, it also provides unique insight into the mind of a genius, whose work was still in the process of maturing at the time of his death. <br>Over a career that spanned three decades, Philip K. Dick (1928 1982) wrote 121 short stories and 45 novels, establishing himself as one of the most visionary authors of the twentieth century. His work is included in the Library of America and has been translated into more than twenty-five languages. Eleven works have been adapted to film, including <i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall</i>, <i>Minority Report</i>, and <i>A Scanner Darkly</i>. <br>"<b>The Transmigration of Timothy Archer</b>, the final novel in the trilogy that also includes <i>Valis</i> and <i>The Divine Invasion</i>, is an anguished, learned, and very moving investigation of the paradoxes of belief. It is the story of Timothy Archer, an urbane Episcopal bishop haunted by the suicides of his son and mistress--and driven by them into a bizarre quest for the identity of Christ.</p><h2>Dairy-Free Ice Cream: 75 Recipes Made Without Eggs, Gluten, Soy, or Refined Sugar</h2><p>In <i>Dairy-Free Ice Cream</i> you will find all of your favorite ice cream flavors free of dairy, gluten, grains, soy, and refined sugar.

Visit www.DrSha.com.<b>1</b><p><b><i></i></b></p><b><i>What Is the Divine Soul Mind Body Healing and Transmission System?</i></b><p>In the introduction, I reviewed and emphasized some key teachings of Soul Mind Body Medicine. These teachings and practical techniques have served hundreds of thousands of people's healing journeys. They will continue to serve humanity more. In this book, I will move from Soul Mind Body Medicine to the Divine Soul Mind Body Healing and Transmission System.</p><p></p><blockquote>Concepts and Wisdom of Soul, Mind, and Body for Everyone and Everything</blockquote><p>In ancient times, there was a renowned spiritual statement:</p><p><b></b></p><blockquote><b>Wan wu jie you ling</b></blockquote><p>"Wan" means <i>ten thousand</i>. In Chinese, "ten thousand" represents <i>all</i> or <i>every</i>. "Wu" means <i>thing</i>. "Jie" means <i>all</i>. "You" means <i>has</i>. "Ling" means <i>soul</i>.</p><p>Therefore, <i>Wan wu jie you ling</i> means <i>everything has a soul</i>.</p><p>Living things have a soul. For example, human beings, animals, insects, bacteria, viruses, trees, and flowers have souls. <i>Wan wu jie you ling</i> emphasizes that <i>inanimate things also have souls</i>. For example, a mountain, a river, a table, a chair, a house, a street, the name of a business, a star, a space, a relationship, and this book, all have souls.</p><p>When you highly develop your spiritual channels, including your Third Eye to see spiritual images and your direct soul communication abilities to have conversations with other souls, you will be able to see a soul clearly in every being and object. You will be able to communicate with any soul. For example, when you stand in front of a mountain, simply say, "Dear soul of the mountain, please come." Instantly, the soul of the mountain will appear in front of you. You can have a conversation with the soul of the mountain, just as you have conversations with your loved ones and friends.</p><p>Everyone and everything in the universe is made of matter. It is very easy to understand that tangible physical things are made of matter. The important secret and teaching I want to share is that even energy, light, and souls are made of matter. Energy is made of tiny matter. Light and souls are made of even tinier matter.</p><p>All matter is in motion. Matter resonates and vibrates constantly. When matter resonates and vibrates, it radiates energy out. Energy is life force. In ancient times, energy was named <i>chi</i> or <i>qi</i>. Five thousand years of traditional Chinese medicine theory and practice have been based on the concept of <i>chi</i>.</p><p>Qi gong was created about four thousand three hundred years ago by Peng Zu (pronounced <i>pung zoo</i>), the teacher of Lao Zi. Peng Zu created <i>Zhi qi zhi dao</i>. "Zhi" means <i>manage</i> or <i>balance</i>. "Qi" means <i>vital energy</i> or <i>life force</i>. The second "zhi" is a possessive particle; it functions like an apostrophe. "Dao" is <i>the Way</i>. <i>Zhi qi zhi dao</i> means <i>the Way to balance qi</i>.</p><p>Peng Zu created this profound teaching with an entire system of practice, including singing songs and chanting mantras, meditations, visualizations, and movement. Peng Zu's system teaches practices in various positions -- lying down, sitting, standing, and walking, practices for the various systems and organs of the body, practices for specific times of day, and more. It is a powerful healing, rejuvenation, transformation, and enlightenment system. With it, Peng Zu lived to the age of eight hundred eighty. He is revered in China as the Long Life Star.</p><p>Today, qi gong has spread from China and is widely popular in the world. Millions of people study qi gong to balance their energy for healing, as well as to boost their energy, stamina, vitality, and immunity. Qi gong is a great practice for rejuvenation and prolonging life.</p><p>To return to matter and energy: In a living thing, matter resides inside the cells. Cells resonate and vibrate constantly. Cells contract and expand constantly. When cells contract, matter inside the cells transforms to energy and radiates out of the cells. When cells expand, energy outside the cells transforms to matter and returns to the cells. When this transformation between matter and energy is in relative balance, health and vitality result.</p><p>The important wisdom and secret to know is that <i>all matter carries a soul</i> and <i>all energy also carries a soul</i>. Let me explain further by presenting the key theory that links matter, energy, and soul.</p><p></p><blockquote>Message Energy Matter Theory -- The Key Spiritual Guidance and Principle for the Divine Soul Mind Body Healing and Transmission System</blockquote><p>The term <i>soul</i> (<i>ling</i> in Chinese) has been used more in China and other Asian countries. <i>Spirit</i> has been used more in Western countries. <i>Message</i> is used more in the scientific field. Soul, spirit, and message are the same thing but with different names.</p><p>Everything is made of matter. Matter includes atoms, protons, neutrons, electrons, quarks, leptons, and more. Matter radiates energy. Matter and energy never disappear. They transform from one to the other.</p><p>Matter and energy are the carriers of message. Message is soul or spirit. <i>Soul is the boss</i>. Soul directs the transformation between matter and energy. This explains the one-sentence secret of soul healing, which is:</p><p><b></b></p><blockquote><b>Heal the soul first; then healing of the mind and body will follow.</b></blockquote><p>Soul has many layers. For example, a human being has a soul of the body (a "body soul"), which is our spirit or essence. Each human being also has a soul for each system, a soul for each organ, a soul for each cell, a soul for each cell unit, a soul for each cell DNA and RNA, a soul for each smallest particle of matter inside the cells, and a soul for each space between the cells. In fact, a human being has billions, trillions of souls, and more.</p><p>For example, scientific study has shown that the brain has billions of cells. This tells us that a brain itself has billions of souls. Each cell has many cell units, DNA, RNA, and smallest matter. Each of these also has a soul. So there will be many billions and trillions more souls of cell units, DNA, RNA, and smallest matter. Every organ has billions and billions of souls. The whole body has too many souls to count. People understand from anatomy that a human being has many systems, organs, and cells. Many people are not aware that every system, organ, and cell has a soul. I'm honored to reveal an important soul secret and wisdom that:</p><p><b></b></p><blockquote><b>A human being has a complete soul system.</b></blockquote><p>How is this complete soul system organized? I will now formally release some important soul secrets:</p><p></p><blockquote>- The body soul is the boss of the system souls, organ souls, cell souls, cell unit souls, DNA and RNA souls, smallest matter souls, and space souls. (I revealed this soul secret in <i>The Power of Soul</i>.)</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>- The soul of the cardiovascular system is the boss of all other system souls.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>- The soul of the heart is the boss of all other organ souls.</blockquote><p></p><blockquote>- The souls of the heart cells, heart cell units, heart DNA and RNA, smallest matter in the heart, and spaces in the heart are the bosses of all other cell souls, cell unit souls, DNA and RNA souls, smallest matter souls, and space souls, respectively.</blockquote><p>This is important wisdom. It tells us that the body soul, the soul of the cardiovascular system, the soul of the heart, and the souls of the cells, cell units, DNA and RNA, smallest matter, and spaces in the heart are the vital souls to heal the body, systems, organs, cells, cell units, DNA and RNA, smallest matter, and spaces.</p><p>Invoke these leader souls. Healing could be very fast. Let me give you one key practice to heal your whole body, including all systems, all organs, all cells, all cell units, all DNA and RNA, all smallest matter, and all spaces in the body at the same time:</p><p>Practice for Whole Body Healing</p><p>First say <i>hello</i>. This is <b>Soul Power</b>.</p><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>Dear my body soul, soul of my cardiovascular system, soul of my heart, and souls of the cells, cell units, DNA and RNA, smallest matter, and spaces in my heart,</i></blockquote><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>I love you, honor you, and appreciate you.</i></blockquote><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>You have the power to heal my body, all systems, all organs, all cells, all cell units, all DNA and RNA, all smallest matter, and all spaces in my body.</i></blockquote><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>Do a good job.</i></blockquote><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>Thank you.</i></blockquote><p>Then, chant repeatedly, silently or aloud. This is <b>Sound Power</b>.</p><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>Heal my whole body, my systems, organs, cells, cell units, DNA and RNA, smallest matter, and spaces. Thank you.</i></blockquote><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>Heal my whole body, my systems, organs, cells, cell units, DNA and RNA, smallest matter, and spaces. Thank you.</i></blockquote><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>Heal my whole body, my systems, organs, cells, cell units, DNA and RNA, smallest matter, and spaces. Thank you.</i></blockquote><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>Heal my whole body, my systems, organs, cells, cell units, DNA and RNA, smallest matter, and spaces. Thank you.</i></blockquote><p>Chant for at least three minutes, the longer, the better.</p><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>Hao! Hao! Hao!</i></blockquote><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</i></blockquote><p>Mind blockages can also be important for one's healing. They are critical to one's spiritual journey. Mind means consciousness. To heal the mind is to transform the consciousness. I have a mind and consciousness. You have a mind and consciousness. Everyone and everything has a mind and consciousness. Our systems, organs, cells, cell units, DNA and RNA, smallest matter in the cells, and spaces between the cells all have a mind and consciousness. There are many kinds of mind blockages. Major mind blockages include negative mind-sets, attitudes, and beliefs, as well as ego and attachment. Mind blockages in our systems, organs, cel...</p></p><h2>Memory, Trauma, and History: Essays on Living with the Past</h2><p>In these essays, Michael S. Roth uses psychoanalysis to build a richer understanding of history, and then takes a more expansive conception of history to decode the cultural construction of memory. He first examines the development in nineteenth-century France of medical criteria for diagnosing memory disorders, which signal fundamental changes in the understanding of present and past. He next explores links between historical consciousness and issues relating to the psyche, including trauma and repression and hypnosis and therapy. Roth turns to the work of postmodern theorists in connection with the philosophy of history and then examines photography&#39;s capacity to capture traces of the past. He considers how we strive to be faithful to the past even when we don&#39;t care about getting it right or using it productively. Roth concludes with essays defending pragmatic and reflexive liberal education. Drawing on his experiences as a teacher and academic leader, he speaks of living with the past without being dominated by it.</p><p><p>An indispensable collection of essays by a university president that deploys psychoanalysis, historiography, critical theory, and photography to make meaning out of the past.</p>Michael S.

Although Dowling has serious reservations about the verdict, his friend Phil Keegan, chief of detectives in Fox River, is pleased with the murder conviction of former showgirl Stacey Wilson, whose rich playboy of a husband was found dead on his yacht on Lake Michigan. Keegan's plain, middle-aged secretary Elaine McCorkle, a member of Dowling's parish, is being wooed by a mysterious young man who suggests he is Stacey's natural son and who persuades Elaine to steal case evidence for him. When Elaine's former beau drowns in his bathtub, Dowling's suspicions are fully activated; he talks to Stacey in prison and begins snooping into the secretary's love affair. Stock characters and few surprises fail to spark life into this flat tale. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Book of Dahlia: A Novel</h2><p>Returning to her native L.A. in search of a new start, Dahlia Finger avoids her dysfunctional family and spends her days in a drug-induced stupor in front of the television, until her diagnosis with an inoperable brain tumor forces her to reevaluate her life. By the author of How This Night Is Different. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>Elisa Albert is the author of the short story collection <i>How This Night is Different </i>and the novel <i>The Book of Dahlia</i>.&nbsp; She has taught creative writing at Columbia University and is currently Writer-in-Residence at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in Holland.<p> <b>Chapter 1: Something Wrong</b> </p><p> <i>Were there signs, willfully ignored? Did you know, on some level, that something was wrong? Did you avoid knowing? What were the signs? What did you know?</i> </p><p> She had been having symptoms. Only recognizable as such in hindsight, but symptoms, nevertheless. A headache. Some sluggishness. Disinclination to do much of anything but hang around her house, take hot showers, slather herself with lavender moisturizer, watch movies on cable, smoke a bowl every few hours, make toaster pastries and consume them methodically, in quarters. Check her email, then check it again. But none of these things much distinguished themselves from Dahlia's normal state, so there had been zero cause for concern. </p><p> Well, concern, sure, but not <i>concern</i>. Just that her life was passing her by. That she might be, in point of fact, wasting her time, herself, utterly. That this might not be a phase. That, okay: What the fuck was she doing? </p><p> She'd figured she was due for a period. She always got those awful headaches, and/or the distended belly, bloat, and/or the general exhaustion. An impending period could explain away pretty much anything. </p><p> There was also the urinary tract infection for which she'd only just the week before completed a course of antibiotics. So there were all these things wrong with her. Not to mention everything, you know, wrong with her. </p><p> On the last day of her ignorance Dahlia Finger woke up shortly before noon, and ate a bowl of Cheerios in front of the television. <i>A League of Their Own</i> was on, for the eighteen-zillionth time, and yet again she found the thing totally irresistible, wound up watching all the way from Jon Lovitz's entree up through Tom Hanks's delivery of a tragic military telegram -- pause for bong hit -- and then straight on to the end, the disappearance of the young lovelies and appearance, in their stead, of riotous old ladies. By then it was almost two in the afternoon and Dahlia was weeping openly about the passage of time and the fact that Geena Davis and Hanks -- so clearly meant for each other -- never got it on, and the sun was threatening to go away for yet another day and so she made herself a cup of tea and looked in the magnifying mirror for a while. Then she called Mara, who was busy at work in Boston and, as usual, could not, or would not, talk. </p><p> "Do you think the Tom character just died alone and drunk?" </p><p> "I don't know, dude. I'm working." Little bit of judgment there, sure. Mara had, as they say, a life. "I'll call you later." </p><p> Dahlia's mother, upon meeting Mara fifteen years earlier, had refused to understand why this girl's name was "<i>mar-ah</i>," which translated, in Hebrew, to <i>bitter</i>. "Mar-ah!" Margalit would squawk. "What kind of name is this for a girl?" Dahlia and Mara had come to appreciate this as funny and fitting. Dahlia always pronounced her friend's name with just that Hebraic lilt to it, because she liked to think Mara was just like her: a match, a true, bitter friend to the true, bitter end. </p><p> Dahlia had taken the GRE a few weeks earlier and was still resting on that semi-laurel: having (sort of) studied for and completed a standardized test so singularly uninteresting she might even have chalked up the headache to her brain trying to rid itself of useless information. The fucking GRE. Barely touched study guides still lay piled in a corner, under some health insurance forms and credit card offers she occasionally considered considering. </p><p> Why the GRE? Possibly social work school. She could consort with drug addicts, or battered women. The broken, the fucked, the totally broken, the irretrievably fucked. This seemed doable. Maybe she had a calling. Maybe she would be happy, self-sufficient, fulfilled, of use to humankind. Make her dad proud. She had just about given up on making Margalit proud, or even holding her attention for too long, come right down to it. </p><p> Anyway, the time had come to do something with herself. "What is your battle plan?" Margalit would often demand. As though life were a long fight one had to orchestrate carefully. </p><p> Dahlia had also toyed, intermittently, with the idea of rabbinical school. A pulpit would allow her to cast Talmudic judgment on people who pissed her off, and work on herself a bit, too, have an answer for everything. She'd be a cool rabbi, a real human being, a pot-headed, pop-culture-expounding Universalist. Except, goddamn it all to hell: Danny was a rabbi. Her douchebag brother, the rabbi! So the whole notion, over before it could begin, defeated her. Everyone already knew Danny, anyhow. They knew him as "Dan" or "Dan the man" or "Rabbi D," from his lifetime of camp counselor-ing and high school mentoring and University Hillel visiting and youth group shepherding: It was an insular, imbecilic universe, and Rabbi Dan, Dahlia's only sibling, was king of it. King Douchebag, Rabbi Dan. </p><p> Fine. So what sort of occupation wouldn't make her want to fucking kill herself every single godforsaken day? Law school sounded like a freaking curse; the words together (LAW-SCHOOL) like some sort of prison sentence handed down in a language she didn't speak, for a crime she didn't commit, by a totalitarian, undemocratic judge in a third world country. Too many rules, too much precision. <i>Laws</i>, for Christ's sake. Thank you, no. </p><p> She had no creative talent to speak of, though she had made a mean mix-tape in her day and certainly counted herself a reasonable connoisseur of culture (witness the umpteenth, slightly ironic <i>League of Their Own</i> screening, the bimonthly live music attendance, the requisite, half-read McSweeney's stacked on the floor by the untouched GRE study guides and untouched health insurance forms, indie theater movie stubs littering the bottom of her bag). She had attempted a spec script or two when she'd moved back to L.A. (because how could she not? She of the ecstatic, repeated viewings of every cheesy movie on cable during any given month's cycle), but they were derivative, unimpressive. One was <i>Sex and the City</i>. The other: <i>Scrubs</i>. Which she had never watched. But Dahlia's mean streak amounted to narratively unaccountable jabs everywhere: at materialism, stupidity, douchebag rabbis, dating websites. "Some fun moments, but way too hostile for episodic television!" said the only TV lit agent she could get to read the thing, the son of an old friend of her father's. "Why would Carrie stop wearing Manolos and decry the shallowness of her own fashion obsession? <i>Sex and the City</i> isn't in production anymore, anyway. Also: <i>Scrubs</i> is a hospital comedy, so it'd be advisable to set the show at or around the hospital. Best of luck." </p><p> It was a pain in the ass, this figuring out what to do with your life. A matter, as the famous book intoned, of finding the shade of parachute that best complemented you. But really: With no parachute at all you'd hit the pavement so hard it probably wouldn't even hurt, and you'd unleash a whole new color palate -- bone, blood, muscle -- in the process. </p><p> So screw the parachute, screw the battle plan. So weed and <i>A League of Their Own</i>. So napping in the breeze. So toaster pastries. So maybe social work school. Or journalism school (though there was the problem of facts with that one, namely a responsibility to them). So the GRE. Whatever. Things would "figure themselves out," as she told her mother. ("<i>Mah zeh</i>, figure themselves out? Nothing figures itself out! What is your <i>battle plan</i>?") </p><p> She was living her life isometrically: action with no movement. </p><p> This was officially a new start, at any rate. She had what her father called "options"; she had nothing but the time and freedom to explore them. She was twenty-nine years old and dear old Daddy Bruce had wiped the slate clean for her. Life in New York, never sustainable in the first place, had become downright unlivable. Bruce, bless his uncomplicated, wealthy heart, had offered her this out: Come home. </p><p> And, indeed, Bruce welcomed his little girl back "home" with a lovely cottage in Venice. He acted like this was Dahlia's right, as expected as hearing her Mirandas or voting. As inevitable as the bearing of arms. Of course she would have a house handed to her, a microscopic mortgage in place for her to pay (but only so she would "learn about money" and be "responsible" for it herself: he had a good deal of cash, but Bruce had "values" as well). </p><p> Dahlia adored the house, loved that it was hers (given, sure, but still). It was a haven, her very own airy bungalow box of clean ocean air. The Spanish tile, the stainless steel, the open kitchen, the recessed lighting, the beamed and soaring ceiling. To get to the front door you had to enter through a wooden gate and walk down a short stone path beset by night-blooming jasmine. She was going to go to Morocco and bring back colored lanterns to hang along this path. She was going to find a wind chime. She was going to get a hammock. She was going to paint the door blue. She felt safe, beyond the reach of all the shit that had dogged her in New York, in college, in high school, in childhood, in utero, and possibly even before that. She was anonymous in Venice; she knew almost nobody and almost nobody knew her. At night, in bed, if she strained, she thought she could hear the Pacific. She felt as though she was re-gestating; that for those first months she was rerooting herself via the cable matinees and pot, via late afternoons strolling Abbott-Kinney, stopping on Main Street for a coffee and a book or a <i>People</i> magazine. Watching movies (<i>Titanic</i>, <i>Flirting with Disaster</i>, <i>Mannequin</i>, <i>Thelma and Louise</i>, <i>Rushmore</i>, <i>The Goonies</i>, <i>She's Having a Baby</i>, it mattered very little) was a kind of prayer: She knew the characters as well as she knew herself, as well as she knew anything there was to know, and she could chart and rechart their movements and secrets and misunderstandings endlessly, reflecting in any number of new permutations on all of it, each time. Again and again. They were acq...</p></p><h2>Right on the Money: Right on the Money</h2><p>Banking whiz and amateur sleuth John Putnam Thatcher is caught in a web of corporate chaos and murder when the merger of a large water-fixture company with a small family-owned appliance business suddenly springs a nasty leak. Reprint.</p><p>This 22nd John Putnam Thatcher financial mystery is an enjoyable--and understandable--puzzler drawing on the intricacies of corporate mergers. When ASI, an upscale, stratified water fixture manufacturer, begins merger negotiations with the mom-and-pop Ecker operation, ASI assistant division manager Victor Hunnicut fears he may soon be squeezed out. To get in on the action, he finagles a way to stand in for his boss in the negotiations but then makes a mess of his tour of Ecker, giving himself airs and spreading unsubstantiated rumors about internal dissension at both ASI and Ecker. Soon after the tour, the building that housed Ecker's financial records and test lab files goes up in flames and Hunnicut is murdered at the annual trade show. Thatcher, a senior vice-president at Wall Street's Sloan Guaranty Trust, which oversees Ecker's finances, works with the police to unravel the numerous scams and schemes. Even readers who don't understand merger financing will enjoy this inside look (Emma Lathen is a pen name shared by an economist and a lawyer), the brisk, smart dialogue and the credible solution to the crime. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.A merger between private-label manufacturer Aqua Supplies, Inc. (ASI), and the Ecker Company, a mom-and-pop client of the Sloan Guaranty Trust, whose main asset is pop Conrad Ecker's uncanny knack for developing small kitchen appliances, is threatened by a suspicious fire in Ecker's record room--and then by meddlesome ASI underling Victor Hunnicut, whose paranoid determination to scuttle the merger ends only when he's skewered during a Manhattan trade show. The police start by going after Conrad's slow-horse production manager, Bob Laverdiere, whose wife Tina had overseen the books that were toasted, and then, finding no flaw in Ecker's finances, they focus on the nervous upper echelons at ASI--but it naturally takes the Sloan's genial veteran John Putnam Thatcher to spot the cleverly concealed culprit. Not as high-concept as Thatcher's recent outings (East is East, 1991, etc.), but with more memorable characters and counterplots. Above average for this blue-chip series. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Desmond MacCarthy was famous as drama and literary critic of &#34;New Statesman&#34; and &#34;The Sunday Times&#34; and his friends included Henry James and Bertrand Russell. Hugh Cecil is MacCarthy&#39;s grandson.</p><p>Desmond MacCarthy (1877-1952) literary critic for the London Sunday Times in the 1930s and '40s, married Molly Warre-Cornish, a cousin of Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell, in 1906. Historian Hugh Cecil, their grandson, and his wife, Mirabel ( Heroines in Love ), propose the MacCarthys as literary lovers, although the romance of that portrait is not borne out in this biography. An account of Desmond's career would have sustained considerable interest in itself. In an era when theater was as important as television is today, he was an influential drama critic. The Cecils' account scants this material in favor of a chronicle of who was related to and/or slept with whom in Merry Olde England between the world wars. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution, Volume 1: Constitutional Documents and Records 1776-1787 (Volume 1)</h2><p>This documentary series is a research tool of remarkable power, an unrivaled reference work for historical and legal scholars, librarians, and students of the Constitution. The volumes are encyclopedic, consisting of manuscript and printed documents-contemporary newspapers, broadsides, and pamphlets-compiled from hundreds of sources, copiously annotated, thoroughly indexed, and often accompanied by microfiche supplements.<br>Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Michael Kammen has noted that <i>The Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution</i> series "will be of enduring value centuries hence" and described it as "one of the most interesting documentary publications we have ever had." The American Bar Association Journal has stated, "Each new volume now fills another vital part of the mosaic of national history."</p><p>&#x201c;Such documents give us a glimpse of America in 1787~88, of its people in their homes, taverns, and streets, their convictions, rituals, and customs. The DHRC captures that moment in all its complexity and powerfully demonstrates how the great documentary editions being published today can, by extending our command of the historical record, transform our knowledge and understanding of the past. It might well be, as the historian Leonard Levy once said, the most important documentary record being published today. Certainly it is the only one dedicated to uncovering the democratic component of the American founding. It is also a monumental scholarly achievement and a gift to all Americans, now and in the future, who want to know how our nation came into being.&#x201d; -Pauline Maier, historian and author of Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787-1788</p><h2>Guide to the Pianist&#x2019;s Repertoire, third edition</h2><p><p>"The Hinson" has been indispensable for performers, teachers, and students.

The story of a talented and opportunistic young cop tracking down a serial killer is not for the squeamish. Perhaps that is why the publishers chose Jeremy Gage to read it-on the theatrical principle of playing against type. He has a particularly UNGRITTY, almost prissy sound. In addition, he is not a particularly interesting reader and at times sounds fatigued, as if fighting off a cold. He handles the characterizations well, though, particularly the women.

The family was exiled to Normandy when the Danish invaded England in 1013 but, with the nation in crisis on the death of King Harthacnut twenty-nine years later, Edward was named King of England, restoring the throne to English rule. Often portrayed as a holy simpleton, Edward was in fact a wily and devious king. For most kings a childless marriage would have been an Achilles&#39; heel, but Edward turned it to his advantage. He cunningly played off his potential rivals and successors, using the prize of the throne as leverage. Though his reign was peaceful, his death would wreak havoc. Bloody wars were waged, two claimants were cut down and William the Conqueror earned his name. Edward&#39;s posthumous reputation grew as stories were spread by the monks of his magnificent foundation, Westminster Abbey. The childless king was transformed into a chaste, pious and holy man. Miracles were attributed to him and he was credited with the King&#39;s Touch - the ability to cure illnesses by touch alone. In 1161 he was canonised as Saint Edward the Confessor and to this day he remains the patron saint of the royal family.</p><p>Peter Rex was Head of History at Prince thorpe College for twenty years. He was an acknowledged expert on Eleventh-century English and Norman history.

As though that would suddenly make her remember who she was. She studied herself in the mirror and didn't recognize the person looking back at her. That revelation only intensified the panic she'd been struggling with ever since she woke up from a coma yesterday. Her fingers clenched the countertop.<br><br>Earlier, the nurse had brought her a few toiletries since she didn't have any. After brushing her hair and putting it into a ponytail, she stared at the red gash, recently healed, above her eyebrow. She closed her eyes and tried to recall how it had happened. The screech of tires echoed through her mind. The sensation of gripping a steering wheel made her hands ache. She looked down at them, her knuckles white.<br><br>A car wreck?<br><br>A sound coming from the other room invaded the quiet. The sudden intrusion kicked up her heartbeat. She moved toward the door, putting her hand around the knob. But when two deep male voices drifted to her, she stopped and pressed her ear against the wood to listen.<br><br>"Where is she?"<br><br>"Who?"<br><br>"The patient who belongs in this room."<br><br>"I don't know. I'm here to clean her room. She wasn't in here when I arrived."<br><br>The sound of the two men talking about her sent her pulse racing even more. Why? It seemed innocent enough. But she couldn't calm the pounding against her chest. Her breathing shortened. One of the voices was familiar. But how could that be? The only interactions she'd had since she'd regained consciousness were with women. She eased the door open an inch and had a pencil-narrow view into the room.<br><br>"I can come back another time. You'll have to ask the nurse where the patient is." The guy who was there to clean her room shifted back and forth while holding a plastic bag in one hand and a dry mop in the other.<br><br>The other man, just out of sight to the left, said, "I will." That was the voice she'd heard somewhere before this. She wished she could see him.<br><br>Instead, she examined the features of the custodian with a beard and dark-slashing eyebrows over a piercing gray gaze. Although he was a complete stranger there was something about his frosty eyes that scared her. She eased the door shut and leaned against it.<br><br>Fear from somewhere deep inside her swelled to the surface. She couldn't get a decent breath. She tried to search her mind for any clue to who she was, to the man with the familiar-sounding voice. A voice with a rough edge to it.<br><br>But what bothered her the most were the custodian's gray eyes. Why? Did she know him? Someone from her past? Then why couldn't she muster the strength to go out there and demand to know who she was?<br><br>Of course that conundrum led to lots of other baffling questions.<br><br>Like...how did she end up in the hospital?<br><br>And were the police interested in her? The nurse last night had told her they would be glad she had awakened, that they needed to talk to her. Why? She knew nothing. At all. Her mind was a blank.<br><br>A suffocating pressure in her chest made it difficult to breathe. A sense of danger pressed in on her. According to Nurse Gail, the police had found her in the Lost Woods several weeks ago. She'd been hurt and disoriented. After she was brought here to the hospital she'd slipped into a coma from a head injury. No one knew how she'd received that wound.<br><br>But why hadn't anyone reported her missing? Come forward to identify her?<br><br>Tears flooded her eyes. She squeezed them shut, refusing to give in to crying. From somewhere she sensed she'd given up doing that a long time ago.<br><br>A knock at the bathroom door caught her by surprise. She gasped, then went still, hoping the person went away.<br><br>"Are you all right in there?"<br><br>She stiffened at the sound of that familiar voice. Words jammed her throat.<br><br>"Ma'am? Are you okay? Should I call the nurse?"<br><br>"Who are you?" she finally managed to ask, her voice wobbly.<br><br>"I'm Lee Calloway with the K-9 Unit of the Sagebrush Police Department." Something in his tone conveyed a concern, urging her to leave the relative safety of the bathroom. Was he the cop who found her? Was that why he sounded familiar to her?<br><br>Laying her trembling hand on the knob, she turned it and opened the door a few inches. "Sagebrush? Where is that?" The large muscular man, resplendent in a dark navy blue police uniform, stepped back. The sight of his badge riveted her attention. Sweat coated her forehead.<br><br>"In Texas, southwest of San Antonio."<br><br>Texas? Did she live here? Maybe someone knew her, had come forward to identify her after all. "Who am I?"<br><br>The corner of his mouth hiked into a lopsided grin. "That, ma'am, is one of the questions I'm here to ask you."<br><br>"One?" Again she stared at the badge for a long moment before she lifted her gaze to take in his face. For a few seconds, she lingered on his mouth curved in that smile. She tore her attention from his lips and tracked upward until she connected with his dark brown eyes. "You don't know who I am, then?" She'd hoped that was why he was there.<br><br>"No, ma'am. When we apprehended you, you didn't have any ID on you. At the time you kept babbling you didn't know your name."<br><br>"I still don't," she whispered more to herself, but he heard her.<br><br>"We ran your fingerprints, but there wasn't a match in the database. And from our inquiries around Sagebrush, no one knows you here...and you weren't reported missing."<br><br>She moved into her hospital room. Aware of its suddenly small dimensions, she kept herself near the door to the corridor. "You said you apprehended me. Am I under arrest?" As she asked that question, she couldn't believe she would be. It didn't feel right&#x2014;in her gut. She couldn't be a criminal, could she?<br><br>"As far as we know, you have done nothing wrong, but we found you in the Lost Woods running from someone or something. You couldn't tell us anything about that. You were scared, had a nasty gash on your head, cuts and bruises all over you. You lost consciousness shortly after I found you. Do you remember anything about that?"<br><br>She took in his features&#x2014;short, sandy-brown hair, piercing dark eyes with long lashes, a dimple in his left cheek when he smiled. A vague memory tugged at her. His face looming over her. "Did you chase me?" Behind her eyes a hammering sensation grew as if the stress of trying to remember was taking its toll on her.<br><br>"When you saw me, you ran, and I went after you."<br><br>"Why did you chase me?" she asked.<br><br>"We believe you might be a witness to a crime that occurred in the Lost Woods."<br><br>"I am?" Trying to think overloaded her mind, a blank one with only shadowy figures wavering, never staying long enough for her to really see them.<br><br>"We were looking for a seven-year-old, Brady Billows, who went missing."<br><br>"I don't know him. Did you find him?" The thought of a child in danger pushed all her problems into the background.<br><br>"Yes, he's safely home with his mother now. That ended well."<br><br>"That's good," she said with a sigh.<br><br>Exhaustion spread through her the longer she stood. The officer was between her and the bed. But if she didn't sit down soon, she would collapse. She moved to the side, intending to skirt around him, when his cell phone rang.<br><br>He answered. "Calloway here." His calm expression evolved into a frown that grooved lines into his forehead. "I'm on my way. I'll meet you there." He returned his cell to his pocket. "Sorry, there's been a development in the Lost Woods. I'll come back later."<br><br>She flattened herself against the wall to allow him to pass her in the short hallway to the door. "A development? What?"<br><br>"Nothing you need to be worried about," he said, and left the room.<br><br>Then why was she worried?<br><br>Lee Calloway drove toward the west end of the Lost Woods where the patrol officer and witness were waiting. From what the dispatcher had told him, there might be another crime committed in the woods on the outskirts of Sagebrush.<br><br>The same area where he found the woman in the hospital room several weeks ago, running as though someone was after her. As far as the police were concerned she was a Jane Doe. What had happened to her? Why was she running in the woods? Who was she running from? Did she know anything about the boy's kidnapping?<br><br>He didn't like mysteries. Probably why he became a cop in the first place. He was always trying to get to the bottom of things. Would he be able to with this beautiful, mysterious woman or would she remain an enigma? The doctor had said she could have amnesia when she woke up, and that certainly seemed to be the case. She might recover all her memory or part of it, but some people never did.<br><br>Had her head injury been the sole reason she couldn't remember, or was it more than that? Some kind of psychological or physical trauma beyond the obvious wound she had sustained? The coma she slipped into was caused by the head injury, according to the doctor. But how and why did she receive it? Still no answer to that question.<br><br>Lee parked near the trailhead into the Lost Woods where the police officer and a young man dressed in a jogging suit waited. When Lee climbed from his SUV, he went to the back and lifted the door. Kip, his black-and-white border collie who worked as a cadaver dog, sat with his tail sweeping back and forth.<br><br>Lee rubbed him behind his ears, one of his favorite places to be scratched. "You ready to work?"<br><br>Kip barked.<br><br>Lee hooked the leash to his dog's halter. "Then let's go."<br><br>Kip jumped from the back of the vehicle and trotted next to Lee as he covered the distance to the patrol officer.<br><br>"What do we have here?" Lee asked, assessing the young man who kept darting glances toward the woods a few yards away.<br><br>The patrol officer started to say something, but the jogger interjected, "I decided to run in a different part of the forest today. I won't do that again. In fact, I may never run here again."<br><br>"What did you find?"<br><br>"Blood, lots of it. I tripped on a root, stumbled and fell. That's when I saw it."<br><br>"Show me."<br><br>The jogger shuffled his feet nervously. "It's a ways in."<br><br>"Fine."<br><br>"I'll stay back. Another K-9 team is coming to help in a search if it's needed," the patrol officer said.<br><br>Lee nodded in agreement and then followed the young man on the path.<br><br>"These woods used to be safe. There was a shooting here not long ago. A kidnapped boy found here. What's happening in Sagebrush?"<br><br>"That's what I aim to find out." As well as the whole Sagebrush special operations K-9 Unit. Their captain's father had been beaten and was still in the hospital, unresponsive. On top of that, Captain Slade McNeal's dog, Rio, was stolen at the same time and hadn't turned up.<br><br>Something big was going down in here. According to Pauly Keevers, a snitch, a major crime syndicate was operating in town so low under the radar that no one knew who The Boss was or the second-in-command. Both used ruthless tactics to get their way.<br><br>"I fell over there." The young man stopped on the path and stepped around some brush. "There's the blood."<br><br>Lee stooped to examine a pile of dead leaves caught against the trunk of a tree. Dried blood caked them. He peered up at the man. "Thanks. I'll take it from here."<br><br>"Do I have to stay? I need to get to work soon."<br><br>"Does the officer have all your contact information?" Lee asked.<br><br>"Yes, he does."<br><br>"Okay, then...you're free to go. Just let the officer know I'm setting up a search."<br><br>As the young man jogged away, Lee rose and took Kip off his leash. If there was a body to be found, his cadaver dog would find it. And from the indication of the amount of blood loss, there very likely was a body somewhere. Kip put his nose to the ground and set out. Lee kept him in sight as his border collie went to work.<br><br>Ten minutes later, Kip stopped and barked. When Lee approached his dog, he stood next to a spot of disturbed ground, his head down, staring at the churned earth.<br><br>"What have you found?"<br><br>Kip barked again, his gaze still trained on the dirt.<br><br>Lee put on some latex gloves, stooped and began to dig carefully. From his dog's behavior, something dead was buried here. When he saw a piece of blue fabric, he ceased.<br><br>"Good boy," Lee said, as he always did whenever his cadaver dog found a body, then he scratched Kip's favorite place before rising. "I'm calling this in." He rotated in a slow circle, searching the area for any other signs of another grave.<br><br>Pulling out his cell, he placed a call to the station to report a body being found. Then while he waited for the crime-scene techs to show up, he checked the surrounding area in case there was another body. There were several low-level criminals missing, including Pauly Keevers who had assisted them recently. Was the body Kip discovered one of them? And could there be other graves in the woods?</p><h2>Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance</h2><p>Discusses the characteristics, behavior, and habits of bears and recommends techniques for guarding against the attacks of bears</p><p>Of all the animals in North America, none commands as much respect, interest, awe, and fear as the bear.

It is also about that group&#39;s practitioners, the psychiatrists and psychologists who have built an elaborate professional structure to cater to our emotional needs. There has been obvious external transformation in our modern world, but the internal shift in man&#39;s psyche has altered both our actions and expectations more than any outside force. The change has taken place quietly, yet it has altered the nature of our civilization beyond recognition. The major agent of change has been modern psychology. When Sigmund Freud visited Clark University in Massachusetts in 1909, psychology was an infant discipline. Today, psychology is an art, science, therapy, religion, moral code, life style, philosophy and cult. It sits at the very center of contemporary society as an international colossus whose professional minions are legion. Its ranks include psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, clinical psychologists, psychotherapists, social workers, psychiatric nurses, school psychologists, guidance counselors, marriage and family therapists, educational psychologists, Sensitivity T- Group and Encounter leaders, and assorted lay therapists. Recently, it has added a number of newly hyphenated professionals including psycholinguists, biopsychologists and psychobiographers. The new Society flourishes on the belief that human technology can remake man as effortlessly as a computerized assembly line. Santayana observed that life is a predicament. The Psychological Society seeks to repeal that truth by offering its techniques as the hope for a scientific Utopia. This book will search out that technology and those who operate it. We will attempt to learn how and why it works, or fails. Only by examining it without awe can we learn how worthwhile, how scientific, how enlightened, or how false and debilitating the Psychological Society truly is.</p><p></p><h2>Spirit of Place : Letters and Essays on Travel</h2><p>From one of the century&#39;s greatest storytellers comes a collection of essays that capture the &#34;spirit of place&#34;Lawrence Durrell&#39;s articles about Mediterranean and Aegean islands along with passages from his letters were first published in 1969. This reissue, with a new cover, is a tribute to Durrell&#39;s belief in the importance of capturing the essence of a place.&#34;My books are always about living in places, not just rushing through them.... the important determinant of any culture is after all -- the spirit of place&#34;.</p><p>Lawrence Durrell was born in 1912 in India. He attended the Jesuit College at Darjeeling and St Edmund&#39;s School, Canterbury. His first literary work, The Black Book, appeared in Paris in 1938. His first collection of poems, A Private Country, was published in 1943, followed by the three Island books: Prospero&#39;s Cell, Reflections on a Marine Venus, about Rhodes, and Bitter Lemons, his account of life in Cyprus. Durrell&#39;s wartime sojourn in Egypt led to his masterpiece, The Alexandria Quartet, which he completed in southern France where he settled permanently in 1957. Between the Quartet and The Avignon Quintet he wrote the two-decker Tunc and Nunquam. His oeuvre includes plays, a book of criticism, translations, travel writing, and humorous stories about the diplomatic corps. Caesar&#39;s Vast Ghost, his reflections on the history and culture of Provence, including a late flowering of poems, appeared a few days before his death in Sommieres in 1990.</p><h2>Field Guide to Coastal Wetland Plants of the Northeastern United States</h2><p>Coastal wetlands are among our most important fish and wildlife habitats.

They do, however, reveal some interesting things about his insomnia and persistent fears (he hates darkness), his literary sources, work habits (he writes two hours a day, seven days a week) and how his scary novels are linked to his childhood insecurities and feelings of inadequacy. The interviews, conducted by various journalists over the past decade, originally ran in media ranging from Penthouse to the Baltimore Sun. Shrugging off critics who dismiss his work as derivative, King explains his fascination with the horrific and calls himself a good writer, not a great one. His comments on his novels and their movie adaptations are often astute, as when he interprets Carrie as a parable of women's consciousness or pans Stanley Kubrick's frigid direction of The Shining. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Stills</h2><p>James Herbert is a long-time filmmaker living and working in Athens, Georgia.

At long last, Appalachian food is emerging vibrantly from a long-time cocoon of stereotypes. With unique culinary roots deeply connected to its geography, agriculture, and traditions, it shows a creativity that ensues from the basic needs of survival combined with the independence and solidness of a mountain people surrounded with peaks and valleys.<br><br> I first encountered Susi at the 2010 Finale of the Asheville Wine &amp; Food Festival, where we both sat on the panel of judges that awarded the prize to the most promising chef of the day&#x2014;Nate Allen&#x2014;who, incidentally is featured in this book. Since then, our paths have crossed many times, through activities with the International Association of Culinary Professionals and Les Dames d&#x2019;Escoffier International, as well as for the 2015 opening of her Seasonal School of Culinary Arts.<br><br> I have been intrigued by Susi&#x2019;s passion for bringing people together over food and for singing out about the place that made her what she is.

As he struggles to come of age in the post-war years, his town struggles to adapt to changes in America that hover over the town like a UFO.<p>Post-war economic growth and the intrusion of the highways, racial injustice, religious revival, accidental death and suicide, the historic struggle of coal miners for safe conditions and decent wages, all leave their mark on both Freddy and the town. He pursues the girl of his dreams as the town changes. It is not till the presidential primary of 1960, as John F.

Employed by the Empress Josephine to record the plants and flowers in her lavish gardens at Malmaison, Redoute began his masterpiece in 1802 -- LES LILLACEES, a set of 486 exquisite watercolours painted on vellum. The plates derived from the watercolours were published in an edition of only 200 copies. This present edition reproduces the entire 468 watercolours known to survive from LES LILLACEES, thus conveying to posterity all the scientific and aesthetic brilliance of the originals. With great delicacy and in remarkable detail Redoute captured the shapes and colours not only of the lily family, but of iris, amaryllis, tulips, even pineapple and bananas -- plants that were difficult to press and dry for herbariums, thus making accurate illustrations an invaluable record. The publication of these paintings, which, remarkably, have survived intact for 170 years, seen by hardly anyone, will be a major event, confirming beyond doubt that LES LILLACEES is one of the greatest colourplate books ever published, and that its creator, Redoute, is the greatest illustrator of flowers of all time.</p><p></p><h2>Tosca&#39;s Christmas</h2><p>Tosca the cat fears she is going to be left out of the celebration this Christmas, until Santa leaves a stocking for her on the mantel.</p><p>Matthew Sturgis is the author of numerous books, including the highly praised Aubrey Beardsley: A Biography and Walter Sickert: A Life, and also a regular reviewer in and contributor to the Times Literary Supplement, the Sunday Telegraph and other papers. Anne Mortimer is recognised as one of the finest contemporary painters of cats. She is a member of the Society of Botanical Artists and of the Royal Miniature Society, from whom she received an honourable mention for the most outstanding miniature of the year. She lives in Dartmouth, Devon.Poor Tosca the cat is totally neglected at Christmastime; she's regarded as a nuisance more than anything else. She gets kicked out of the kitchen when everyone is baking, and out of the bedroom when they are wrapping presents. Even Tosca's favorite chair is displaced by a strange tree that dominates the living room. When Tosca topples the tree (she was only trying to get to the angel to request a present) she is banished to the cold outdoors. In the end, it is Santa who befriends this gorgeous but woebegone cat, giving Tosca her very own present and providing the comfortable lap she's been looking for. Mortimer's loving portraits of Tosca are painted from the cat's floor-level perspective, and the reader never sees the faces of those unfeeling humans whose house she shares. Both Sturgis and Mortimer have succeeded in capturing the warmth of the holidays from a delightfully different viewpoint; Tosca's story serves to remind readers that Christmas is a season of loving and sharing.

He clarifies recent mathematical reinterpretations of classical political economy, so that philosophers, political scientists, psychologists, and sociologists interested in Marx's theories can understand the modern rehabilitation of his political economy.</p><p>Originally published in 1985.</p></p><p></p><h2>The tea ceremony</h2><p>In Japan, serving tea is an art and a spiritual discipline. As an art, the tea ceremony is an occasion to appreciate the clean lines of the tea room's design, the feel of the bowl in the hand, the company of friends, and a simple moment of purity. As a discipline, it has roots in the twelfth century and intimate connections to architecture, landscape gardening, ceramics, painting, flower arrangement, and, of course, Zen Buddhism. <br><br>Written by contemporary tea masters, <em>The Tea Ceremony</em> takes a clear and comprehensive look at the sources and inspiration of this ancient discipline. The authors trace the practice from its earliest origins to the present day, considering in detail the individuals who helped it evolve. They discuss all the elements of the ceremony-including art, architecture, incense, flowers, and the influence of Zen-and show how readily the study of tea can serve as a spiritual path to greater insight and calm. <br><br>Originally published in 1973, <em>The Tea Ceremony</em> has been revised extensively.

But the story of the Dutch colony of New Netherland was merely lost, not destroyed: 12,000 pages of its records-recently declared a national treasure-are now being translated. Drawing on this remarkable archive, Russell Shorto has created a gripping narrative-a story of global sweep centered on a wilderness called Manhattan-that transforms our understanding of early America. The Dutch colony pre-dated the &#34;original&#34; thirteen colonies, yet it seems strikingly familiar. Its capital was cosmopolitan and multi-ethnic, and its citizens valued free trade, individual rights, and religious freedom. Their champion was a progressive, young lawyer named Adriaen van der Donck, who emerges in these pages as a forgotten American patriot and whose political vision brought him into conflict with Peter Stuyvesant, the autocratic director of the Dutch colony. The struggle between these two strong-willed men laid the foundation for New York City and helped shape American culture. The Island at the Center of the World uncovers a lost world and offers a surprising new perspective on our own.</p><p></p><h2>Diplomatic Studies in Latin and Greek Documents from the Carolingian Age</h2><p>This distinguished and erudite work deals exhausively with a number of important questions concerning the authorship and origins of the Libri Carolini, the greatest literary and teologico-political document of the Carolingian Age.

She's had too much to drink. Cynthia has been topping her up all night. Anne had meant to keep herself to a limit, but she'd let things slide-she didn't know how else she was supposed to get through the evening. Now she has no idea how much wine she's drunk over the course of this interminable dinner party. She'll have to pump and dump her breast milk in the morning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anne wilts in the heat of the summer night and watches her hostess with narrowed eyes. Cynthia is flirting openly with Anne's husband, Marco. Why does Anne put up with it? Why does Cynthia's husband, Graham, allow it? Anne is angry but powerless; she doesn't know how to put a stop to it without looking pathetic and ridiculous. They are all a little tanked. So she ignores it, quietly seething, and sips at the chilled wine. Anne wasn't brought up to create a scene, isn't one to draw attention to herself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cynthia, on the other hand . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All three of them-Anne, Marco, and Cynthia's mild-mannered husband, Graham-are watching her, as if fascinated. Marco in particular can't seem to take his eyes off Cynthia. She leans in a little too close to Marco as she bends over and fills his glass, her clingy top cut so low that Marco's practically rubbing his nose in her cleavage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anne reminds herself that Cynthia flirts with everyone. Cynthia has such outrageous good looks that she can't seem to help herself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But the longer Anne watches, the more she wonders if there could actually be something going on between Marco and Cynthia. Anne has never had such suspicions before. Perhaps the alcohol is making her paranoid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No, she decides-they wouldn't be carrying on like this if they had anything to hide. Cynthia is flirting more than Marco is; he is the flattered recipient of her attentions. Marco is almost too good-looking himself-with his tousled dark hair, hazel eyes, and charming smile, he's always attracted attention. They make a striking couple, Cynthia and Marco. Anne tells herself to stop it. Tells herself that of course Marco is faithful to her. She knows he is completely committed to his family. She and the baby are everything to him. He will stand by her no matter what-she takes another gulp of wine-no matter how bad things get.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But watching Cynthia drape herself over Marco, Anne is becoming more and more anxious and upset. She is still more than twenty pounds overweight from her pregnancy, six months after having the baby. She thought she'd be back to her pre-pregnancy figure by now, but apparently it takes at least a year. She must stop looking at the tabloids at the grocery-store checkout and comparing herself to all those celebrity moms with their personal trainers who look terrific after mere weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But even at her best, Anne could never compete with the likes of Cynthia, her taller, shapelier neighbor-with her long legs, nipped-in waist, and big breasts, her porcelain skin and tumbling jet-black hair. And Cynthia always dressed to kill, in high heels and sexy clothes-even for a dinner party at home with one other couple.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anne can't focus on the conversation around her. She tunes it out and stares at the carved marble fireplace, exactly like the one in her own living-dining room, on the other side of the common wall that Anne and Marco share with Cynthia and Graham; they live in attached brick row houses, typical of this city in upstate New York, solidly built in the late nineteenth century. All the houses in the row are similar-Italianate, restored, expensive-except that Anne and Marco's is at the end of the row and each reflects slight differences in decoration and taste; each one is a small masterpiece.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anne reaches clumsily for her cell phone on the dining table and checks the time. It is almost one o'clock in the morning. She'd checked on the baby at midnight. Marco had gone to check on her at twelve thirty. Then he'd gone out for a cigarette on the back patio with Cynthia, while Anne and Graham sat rather awkwardly at the littered dining table, making stilted conversation. She should have gone out to the backyard with them; there might have been a breeze. But she hadn't, because Graham didn't like to be around cigarette smoke, and it would have been rude, or at least inconsiderate, to leave Graham there all alone at his own dinner party. So for reasons of propriety, she had stayed. Graham, a WASP like herself, is impeccably polite. Why he married a tart like Cynthia is a mystery. Cynthia and Marco had come back in from the patio a few minutes ago, and Anne desperately wants to leave, even if everyone else is still having fun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She glances at the baby monitor sitting at the end of the table, its small red light glowing like the tip of a cigarette. The video screen is smashed-she'd dropped it a couple of days ago and Marco hadn't gotten around to replacing it yet-but the audio is still working. Suddenly she has doubts, feels the wrongness of it all. Who goes to a dinner party next door and leaves her baby alone in the house? What kind of mother does such a thing? She feels the familiar agony set in-she is not a good mother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what if the sitter canceled? They should have brought Cora with them, put her in her portable playpen. But Cynthia had said no children. It was to be an adult evening, for Graham's birthday. Which is another reason Anne has come to dislike Cynthia, who was once a good friend-Cynthia is not baby-friendly. Who says that a six-month-old baby isn't welcome at a dinner party? How had Anne ever let Marco persuade her that it was okay? It was irresponsible. She wonders what the other mothers in her moms' group would think if she ever told them. We left our six-month-old baby home alone and went to a party next door. She imagines all their jaws dropping in shock, the uncomfortable silence. But she will never tell them. She'd be shunned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She and Marco had argued about it before the party. When the sitter called and canceled, Anne had offered to stay home with the baby-she hadn't wanted to go to the dinner anyway. But Marco was having none of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You can't just stay home," he insisted when they argued about it in their kitchen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm fine staying home," she said, her voice lowered. She didn't want Cynthia to hear them through the shared wall, arguing about going to her party.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It will be good for you to get out," Marco countered, lowering his own voice. And then he'd added, "You know what the doctor said."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All night long she's been trying to decide whether that last comment was mean-spirited or self-interested or whether he was simply trying to help. Finally she'd given in. Marco persuaded her that with the monitor on next door they could hear the baby anytime she stirred or woke. They would check on her every half hour. Nothing bad would happen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is one o'clock. Should she check on Cora now or just try to get Marco to leave? She wants to go home to bed. She wants this night to end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She pulls her husband's arm. "Marco," she urges, "we should leave. It's one o'clock."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, don't go yet," Cynthia says. "It's not that late!" She obviously doesn't want the party to be over. She doesn't want Marco to leave. She wouldn't mind at all if Anne left, though, Anne is pretty sure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Maybe not for you," Anne says, and she manages to sound a little stiff, even though she's drunk, "but I have to be up early to feed the baby."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Poor you," Cynthia says, and for some reason this infuriates Anne. Cynthia has no children, nor has she ever wanted any. She and Graham are childless by choice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Getting Marco to leave the party is difficult. He seems determined to stay. He's having too much fun, but Anne is growing anxious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Just one more," Marco says to Cynthia, holding up his glass, avoiding his wife's eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He is in a strangely boisterous mood tonight-it seems almost forced. Anne wonders why. He's been quiet lately, at home. Distracted, even moody. But tonight, with Cynthia, he's the life of the party. For some time now, Anne has sensed that something is wrong, if only he would tell her what it is. He isn't telling her much of anything these days. He's shutting her out. Or maybe he's withdrawing from her because of her depression, her "baby blues." He's disappointed in her. Who isn't? Tonight he clearly prefers the beautiful, bubbly, sparkly Cynthia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anne notices the time and loses all patience. "I'm going to go. I was supposed to check on the baby at one." She looks at Marco. "You stay as late as you like," she adds, her voice tight. Marco looks sharply at her, his eyes glittering. Suddenly Anne thinks he doesn't seem that drunk at all, but she feels dizzy. Are they going to argue about this? In front of the neighbors? Really? Anne begins to glance around for her purse, gathers up the baby monitor, realizes then that it's plugged into the wall, and bends over to unplug it, aware of everyone at the table silently staring at her fat ass. Well, let them. She feels like they're ganging up on her, seeing her as a spoilsport. Tears start to burn, and she fights them back. She does not want to burst into tears in front of everyone. Cynthia and Graham don't know about her postpartum depression. They wouldn't understand. Anne and Marco haven't told anyone, with the exception of Anne's mother. Anne has recently confided in her. She knows that her mother won't tell anyone, not even her father. Anne doesn't want anyone else to know, and she suspects Marco doesn't either, although he hasn't said as much. But pretending all the time is exhausting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While her back is turned, she hears Marco's change of heart in the tone of his voice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You're right. It's late, we should go," he says. She hears him set his wineglass on the table behind her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anne turns around, brushing the hair out of her eyes with the back of her hand. She desperately needs a haircut. She gives a fake smile and says, "Next time it's our turn to host." And adds silently, You can come to our house, where our child lives with us, and I hope she cries all night and spoils your evening. I'll be sure to invite you when she's teething.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They leave quickly after that. They have no baby gear to gather up, just themselves, Anne's purse, and the baby monitor, which she shoves into it. Cynthia looks annoyed at their swift departure-Graham is neutral-and they make their way out the impressively heavy front door and down the steps. Anne grabs hold of the elaborately carved handrail to help her keep her balance. It is just a few short paces along the sidewalk until they are at their own front stairs, with a similar handrail and an equally impressive front door. Anne is walking slightly ahead of Marco, not speaking. She may not speak to him for the rest of the night. She marches up the steps and stops dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What?" Marco says, coming up behind her, his voice tense.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anne is staring. The front door is ajar; it is open about three inches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I know I locked it!" Anne says, her voice shrill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marco says tersely, "Maybe you forgot. You've had a lot to drink."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Anne isn't listening. She's inside and running up the staircase and down the hall to the baby's room, with Marco right at her heels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When she gets to the baby's room and sees the empty crib, she screams.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anne feels her scream inside her own head and reverberating off the walls-her scream is everywhere. Then she falls silent and stands in front of the empty crib, rigid, her hand to her mouth. Marco fumbles with the light switch. They both stare at the empty crib where their baby should be. It is impossible that she not be there. There is no way Cora could have gotten out of the crib by herself. She is barely six months old.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Call the police," Anne whispers, then throws up, the vomit cascading over her fingers and onto the hardwood floor as she bends over. The baby's room, painted a soft butter yellow with stencils of baby lambs frolicking on the walls, immediately fills with the smell of bile and panic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marco doesn't move. Anne looks up at him. He is paralyzed, in shock, staring at the empty crib, as if he can't believe it. Anne sees the fear and guilt in his eyes and starts to wail-a horrible, keening sound, like an animal in pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marco still doesn't budge. Anne bolts across the hall to their bedroom, grabs the phone off the bedside table, and dials 911, her hands shaking, getting vomit all over the phone. Marco finally snaps out of it. She can hear him walking rapidly around the second floor of the house while she stares across the hall at the empty crib. He checks the bathroom, at the top of the stairs, then passes quickly by her on his way to search the spare bedroom and then the last room down the hall, the one they have turned into an office. But even as he does, Anne wonders in a detached way why he is looking there. It's as if part of her mind has split off and is thinking logically. It's not like their baby is mobile on her own. She is not in the bathroom, or the spare bedroom, or the office.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Someone has taken her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the emergency operator answers, Anne cries, "Someone has taken our baby!" She is barely able to calm herself enough to answer the operator's questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I understand, ma'am. Try to stay calm. The police are on their way," the operator assures her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anne hangs up the phone. Her whole body is trembling. She feels like she is going to be sick again. It occurs to her how it will look. They'd left the baby alone in the house. Was that illegal? It must be. How will they explain it?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marco appears at the bedroom door, pale and sick-looking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"This is your fault!" Anne screams, wild-eyed, and pushes past him. She rushes into the bathroom at the top of the stairs and throws up again, this time into the pedestal sink, then washes the mess from her shaking hands and rinses her mouth. She catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror. Marco is standing right behind her. Their eyes meet in the mirror.</p></p><h2>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0: Mastery your emotions, develop and boost your EQ to improve the skill to business and relationship</h2><p><p><strong><em>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>MASTERY YOUR EMOTIONS, DEVELOP AND BOOST YOUR EI TO IMPROVE THE SKILL TO BUSINESS AND RELATIONSHIP</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&#x201c;Never let your emotions overpower your intelligence&#x201d;</em></strong></p><p>Emotional intelligence is a solid foundation that will allow a person to have the ability to understand their own emotions and those of other people that they may encounter.&nbsp;&nbsp;In today&#x2019;s corporate world it&#x2019;s essential that a person knows how to control their emotions in order to climb the corporate&nbsp;ladder of success.</p><p>It is important that&nbsp;people&nbsp;recognize their own emotions and those of others.&nbsp;&nbsp;They&nbsp;must know when to&nbsp;discern between different feelings and label them appropriately.

Intriguing, rigorous, and vital, they are nevertheless rooted within three major academic disciplines - history, literary studies, and bibliography - that focus respectively upon the book as a cultural transaction, a literary text, and a material artefact. <em>Old Books and New Histories</em> serves as a guide to this rich but sometimes confusing territory, explaining how different scholarly approaches to what may appear to be the same entity can lead to divergent questions and contradictory answers. Rather than introduce the events and turning points in the history of book culture, or debates among its theorists, Leslie Howsam uses an array of books and articles to offer an orientation to the field in terms of disciplinary boundaries and interdisciplinary tensions. Howsam's analysis maps studies of book and print culture onto the disciplinary structure of the North American and European academic world. </p><p><em>Old Books and New Histories</em> is also an engaged statement of the historical perspective of the book. In the final analysis, the lesson of studies in book and print culture is that texts change, books are mutable, and readers ultimately make of books what they need.</p></p><p><p><b>Leslie Howsam</b> is a professor in the Department of History at the University of Windsor.</p></p><h2>The Life of Maynard Dixon</h2><p><p><i>A personal portrait of an early-20th-century painter. </i></p> <p>Maynard Dixon embellished themes that encompassed the timeless truth of the majestic western landscape, the humanity of its memorable people, and the religious mysticism of the Native American.

Though George Vanderbilt's 255-room Biltmore had recently put the American country house on the money map, John D. Rockefeller, who detested ostentation, had something simple in mind--at least until his son John Jr. and his charming wife, Abby, injected a spirit of noblesse oblige into the equation. Built to honor the senior Rockefeller, the house would also become the place above all others that anchored the family's memories. There could never be a better picture of the Rockefellers and their ambitions for the enormous fortune Senior had settled upon them. <br>The authors take us inside the house and the family to observe a century of building and rebuilding--the ebb and flow of events and family feelings, the architecture and furnishings, the art and the gardens. A complex saga, <i>The House the Rockefellers Built</i> is alive with surprising twists and turns that reveal the tastes of a large family often sharply at odds with one&nbsp; another about the fortune the house symbolized.</p><p>Robert F.

December 1991<br>&nbsp;<br>It had always felt like the most private of places. Now after more than eighty years that was about to change, and though arguably the entire family was losing a part of its heritage, it was the youngest among them, the children of "the cousins," who seemed to feel most deeply the need to mark the break. So it was that on a December night in 1991 the fifth generation of the Rockefeller family--counting from John D. Rockefeller Sr. and his wife, Laura Celestia ("Cettie") Spelman Rockefeller, for whom the house had been built--gathered in the dining room of Kykuit for a farewell dinner. "It was an extraordinary evening where everyone reminisced about their childhood experiences on the estate," remarked one person afterward. Someone else recalled walking through the house and gardens, "just thinking how sad it was that it was changing. It was the end. It wasn't going to be a family house anymore. It was going to be a public place."<br>&nbsp;<br>In the past, the dinner served that night would have been prepared by the house's own staff of servants, but since only a skeleton crew remained indoors the food was brought in by hired caterers. Still, with the china and crystal gleaming softly in candlelight as the four courses of the meal were passed to person after person, everything must have seemed much as it always had, except that this was indeed the last family dinner in the house. Two weeks later Kykuit was turned over to the National Trust for Historic Preservation to be readied for a long-heralded program of public tours of "the Rockefeller Family Home."<br>&nbsp;<br>In May 1994, the month the tours began, the New York Times ran no fewer than three articles on Kykuit. By the time the third appeared, reservations were booked for the remainder of the year, and the newspaper was describing the attention focused on the opening of the house as "more or less akin to that surrounding the start of public tours of Buckingham Palace." As for the place itself, the Times architectural critic, Paul Goldberger, was guarded in his assessment, but overall his verdict was favorable. "Oddly restrained, almost hesitant, and rather tight in its proportions" was one comment, yet that was tempered later in the same article by another observation: "The house's mix of idiosyncrasy and restraint stands in welcome contrast to the self-important hauteur of the average pile of stone in Newport . . . There is nothing vulgar here, and that alone separates Kykuit from almost every other great house produced in the golden age of American wealth," a judgment with which the public seemed to agree. "You know it really was a very livable mansion," remarked one woman, who had come from two hours away in Connecticut to see Kykuit.<br>&nbsp;<br>As the guides on the tours explained, it was Nelson Rockefeller, the longtime governor of New York and the last member of the family to live in the house, who had paved the way for opening it to the public by stipulating in his will that his share of the estate, along with much of his large collection of modern art, should go to the National Trust. Left undescribed on the tour, however, were the complex and often strained negotiations necessary to give reality to Nelson's plans for Kykuit, negotiations that stretched on for fourteen years. Nevertheless, in the end his wishes were honored, and the house, together with its contents and eighty-six acres of land, passed out of the Rockefellers' hands and into those of the National Trust.<br>&nbsp;<br>During most of the interim between Nelson's death and the transfer, no one lived in "the Big House," but the family continued to hold events there, including weddings, birthday parties, christenings, and gatherings of representatives of at least half a dozen different Rockefeller charities. Several fifth-generation members even organized a seminar on the family's history, including the life and career of its patriarch, John D. Rockefeller Sr. himself. In addition, there was that final dinner, planned by the same generation, and purposely timed to precede the annual family Christmas luncheon scheduled for the next day. Over the years the number of people attending the Christmas luncheon had grown so large that it had to be held next door in the estate's coach barn. But after the meal, those present decided to go up to the house and hold "a simple ceremony to say good-bye to the place" they had known all their lives. Not all of them had been fond of Kykuit, and at least a few had decidedly negative feelings about it. Still, standing in a circle they shared their memories, lighting candles as they spoke, "until there was a ring of light commemorating all that had been and all that was being let go."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Let go? Yes. An ending? Unquestionably. But not quite, perhaps, the change from private to public that some people saw, at least in any simple sense. For Kykuit's privacy had always been more a matter of illusion than reality; given the individuals who built the house and lived there, it could not have been otherwise. The Rockefellers, particularly in the first three generations, were too rich and too prominently involved in too many different areas of American life to enjoy the luxury of privacy as most people know it. For much of his life John D. Rockefeller Sr. managed to ignore that fact, but his son and namesake discovered it soon enough, as did his children. Yet at Kykuit it had still seemed possible to will away the ever-present spotlight of public attention. That was the charm of the place. The great granite-clad house perched high on its hilltop overlooking the Hudson River, the handsome high-ceilinged rooms filled with works of art, the acres of beautifully tended gardens adorned with arresting sculptures--what else was it all for if not to serve as a private refuge, a source of pleasure for its owners and those lucky enough to be invited to see it?<br>&nbsp;<br>What else indeed, yet neither John D. Rockefeller nor his son thought of it that way. In their eyes life was not about pleasure; it was about work and accumulation and the careful disposition of what had been accumulated. That was the lesson father taught son, as he himself had learned it from his mother, the redoubtable Eliza Davison Rockefeller. Moreover, as the family moved into the twentieth century the emphasis would increasingly shift from "getting" to "giving," as John D. Sr. liked to put it, from constantly piling up money to using it on an ever-grander scale to do good in the larger world. The building of Kykuit both coincided with that shift and was intimately connected to it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Writing about Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, the architectural historian Dell Upton describes it as both "a hermitage"--a private retreat--and a "republican" place, designed to teach those who encountered it the principles of civic virtue. Upton also sees this dual identity as characteristic of more than a few American elite houses, and certainly, given the history of its building, Kykuit meets the test. But as with so much else about the Rockefellers, the scale of things tended to change the usual formulas. Thomas Jefferson died deeply in debt, in no small part because of what he spent building and rebuilding Monticello. The day John D. Rockefeller moved into Kykuit he was widely assumed to be the richest man in the world, and the bulk of his wealth would remain either in family hands or in the hands of institutions controlled by the family.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet for all its durability, the Rockefellers' wealth could not be made infinitely elastic. With each succeeding generation the great fortune was divided into smaller and smaller pieces. By the time Kykuit was turned over to the National Trust, no one in the fourth and fifth generations of the family could have afforded to live there, even if they had wanted to. In this way, too, the passing of the house from family ownership marked a change, and no doubt a poignant one for many people present at those farewell events.<br>&nbsp;<br>To be sure, reactions varied. One person at that final dinner described stripping off his clothes later in the evening and striding naked into his great-great-grandfather's "incredible shower with the millions of nickel-plated spigots, shower heads, and liver sprays." A bit of good-natured fun, undoubtedly, but showers of that sort had once been badges of the kind of near-limitless wealth no single Rockefeller any longer possessed, just as being a Rockefeller had once meant--and now no longer would--claiming Kykuit as your "family seat."<br>&nbsp;<br>Still, the house itself survives and remains a fascinating artifact, rich in historical significance, which it is the purpose of this book to unravel. On one level, it is a story of money, power, and taste--that elusive entity, which at Kykuit was meant to both fuse the other two and lift them to a higher plane. On the subject of taste, too, the New York Times was definitely right: Kykuit is different from other houses built by the American rich. The taste that shaped it was not the taste of a particular group or class. It was, quintessentially, the Rockefellers' taste. And what gave it its distinctive character was the underlying conviction that things, the tangible props of daily life, ought to mean something beyond the ordinary ends they served. If taste is the pursuit of excellence, excellence at Kykuit invariably came to a matter of moral judgment. It was not enough for things to be useful, or fashionable, or even beautiful; they also had to be good.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Rockefellers were hardly alone in imputing moral qualities to physical objects. Every human culture has had its sacred totems. But their creation generally depends on long-standing, deeply rooted structures of collective consensus. In the Rockefellers' case it all happened so quickly, fueled by energies coming from so many different directions at once, that consensus constantly eluded the family. Indeed, what most surprised us while we were working on the book was how often and how sharply they disagreed with one another in their anxious search for the proper material forms in which to clothe their moral aspirations. And from the beginning a major source of those disagreements was Kykuit itself. John D. Rockefeller Sr. had wanted to build a simple family home; his son had much loftier ambitions for the place. The same son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., disliked modern art, yet his wife, Abby, became one of the founders of the Museum of Modern Art, and the chastely banal nudes he chose for the gardens at Kykuit would eventually have to share the space with works by Picasso, Lachaise, Maillol, and Henry Moore put there by their son, Nelson Rockefeller. Husbands and wives, sons and brothers, they all had their own opinions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Still, they pressed on with their quest, for on a deeper level what was at stake was one of the most perplexing issues in American life: the proper place of great wealth in a democracy. The twenty years before, Kykuit's building had witnessed, in the United States, an altogether unprecedented accumulation of riches in private hands. Should that circumstance be celebrated as a triumphant affirmation of the benefits of a social order unfettered by fixed position and privilege? Or was it fundamentally inimical to the health and well-being of such a society? "Plutocrats," "robber barons," "malefactors of great wealth"--the less flattering labels widely applied to the possessors of the new wealth made clear just how uncomfortable many Americans were with the phenomenon. And no family was more thoroughly condemned for its wealth and the methods that had produced it than the Rockefellers. How could a fortune the size of theirs, earned as it had been, possibly be compatible with the nation's traditional democratic ideals? That was the question that confronted the family.<br>&nbsp;<br>John D. Rockefeller Sr.'s answer was to live frugally and give an ever-increasing portion of his fortune away. But there were those who argued that in so doing he ignored the higher cultural values that it was also the duty of the rich to promote, for great democratic societies do not, cannot, live by bread alone. Nor was this just the view of his critics; it was also what his own son came to feel. If evidence was needed to prove that wealth and democracy were in fact compatible, "Junior," as he was called, believed Kykuit ought to serve that end by being modest and unpretentious--no opulent palace, certainly--yet still beautiful, its architecture and contents displaying the highest, most noble values. Since the values were universal, the connection to democracy would be obvious. Obvious too, or so the family hoped, would be the fact this was the home not of greedy, self-seeking individuals but of decent, civic-minded people, determined to do good with the riches that God and the American system of capitalistic enterprise had showered upon them. And if all that seemed like a heavy burden for any house to bear, through most of the twentieth century the Rockefellers never doubted for a moment that it was possible, however strenuously they disagreed about the details.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2007 by Robert F.

The trader was barefoot and shirtless, his straight black hair slicked away from his round face, emphasizing the narrow, heavy-lidded eyes that, even when things were going badly, held some inner amusement&#x2014;often, as this morning, at Jerzy&#x2019;s expense.<br><br>Above him, the wind snapped the canvas sails and rattled the main. The air was sweet and salty; large white birds sailed overhead, calling out in harsh, high voices as they searched for breakfast in the waters below; and the sun was only just rising, turning the briny blue-green depths into a brighter aquamarine.<br><br>Jerzy would have traded it all for a miserably rainy day in the dankest room anywhere on solid land.<br><br>&#x201c;I hate you,&#x201d; he said, leaning against the wooden railing and wishing that his limbs would stop shaking already.<br><br>Ao laughed, but there was real sympathy in his voice. &#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Here.&#x201d; The trader handed him a towel to wipe his mouth. The cloth was scratchy linen, air-dried and smelling of mildew and sea spray, but Jerzy barely noticed at this point. They had been at sea for ten days now, and he had been sick every single morning.<br><br>Jerzy pushed a sweat-damp lock of hair off his forehead and mopped his skin with the towel, then looked up at the dun-colored sail snapping in the breeze above them. The creaking, slapping noise still sounded dangerous to him, but he freely admitted that he knew nothing about boats or sailing, leaving that to Ao and the third member of their party who was currently at the helm, steering them through the waters.<br><br>The thought of her made him look over his shoulder to where Mahault stood tall and proud at the wheel, her attention on the far horizon, where water seemed to merge into sky without a single obstacle to mar the view.<br><br>Her blond hair was no longer caught up in the formal, complicated knot she had worn as the daughter of the lord-maiar of Aleppan, but was instead braided into a thick plait, hanging halfway down her back. The time under the open skies had bleached it from deep gold to the color of straw, and darkened her smooth skin to a pale brown, almost exactly the color of tai, the bark brew popular back home. Her lady-mother would have been outraged to see her daughter looking so much like a common sailor.<br><br>The fact that Mahault seemed happier now, free and browned, than she had been the entire time he had known her in Aleppan, took away some of the regret Jerzy felt at his involvement in her exile.<br><br>The thought made him grimace. Mahault would have glared at him if she knew he was taking any responsibility at all for her actions&#x2014;she had made the decision to leave on her own; in fact, she had used their rescue of him to make her own escape. An exile, yes, but a chosen one, against worse options.<br><br>And at that, she was faring better than he&#x2014;not only was he a poor sailor, but his skin pinked under the sun, burning at the bend of his arms and back of his neck unless he kept them covered. Ao assured him that the skin would darken over time, adapting to the different weather, but Jerzy didn&#x2019;t want to spend enough time here to discover the truth of that. He wanted to go home.<br><br>Unfortunately, that was the one place he could not go.<br><br>Eleven days ago they had fled the city of Aleppan, barely one step ahead of Washers who named Jerzy apostate, oath-breaker, saying that he had broken Sin Washer&#x2019;s Commandment forbidding one Vineart from interfering with the vines of another.<br><br>It was a crime punishable by death.<br><br>Jerzy was not guilty of that crime, but he was not innocent, either.<br><br>Master Vineart Malech, Jerzy&#x2019;s master and teacher, had sent him to Aleppan under the guise of studying with Vineart Giordan&#x2014;itself an unheard-of breach in tradition&#x2014;to listen, in that city of trade and gossip, for further news of recent, disturbing events: magic-crafted serpents attacking shoreline villages, strange disappearances of Vinearts, out-of-season vine infestations, and more they had not yet heard about.<br><br>Instead, Jerzy had discovered that the strange happenings went deeper than Master Malech could have dreamed, attacking not only Vinearts and villagers, but men of power as well. While trying to investigate, he had been caught up in lines of deceit and magic entangling the lord-maiar, Mahault&#x2019;s father, and turning Aleppan into a deadly trap for both Jerzy and Vineart Giordan.<br><br>Ao and Mahault had risked everything to help Jerzy escape, fleeing the city on horseback with only what Mahault had had time to throw into packs, and no idea where they would go or what they could do.<br><br>Unable to contact his master, with not only his own survival but his companions&#x2019; to consider as well, Jerzy had decided to go to the one place where he could not be easily tracked: open water. As a member of the Eastern Wind trading clan, however junior, Ao had been able to barter their two horses and Mahault&#x2019;s jewelry for this ship. It was seaworthy but small, and not meant to be taken out of sight of the shoreline.<br><br>Given a choice, Jerzy would never have willingly set foot on another boat, after his terrible sickness on the way from his home in The Berengia to Aleppan. The risk of illness was welcome, compared to the options: if they stayed on the shore, they would have been retaken, he would have been killed, and Ao and Mahault ... he did not know what would happen to them, but it would not have been good.<br><br>The three of them had agreed that until they determined how far the search for them had spread, it was safer here on the empty waters, where they could see any pursuit coming. Their supplies were limited, though, and they needed to replenish their fresh water or they would die of thirst, surrounded by seemingly endless blue waves.<br><br>Jerzy felt the responsibility for their situation keenly; it was his fault, his failure that had brought them to this. He had promised to give his companions a chance to recoup the losses incurred when they linked their fates to his ... but he had no idea how to do that. More, he could not allow that promise to become his foremost priority. He was Jerzy of the House Malech; his first and only obligation was to warn his master of what he had learned in Aleppan.<br><br>But Jerzy had no way to contact Master Malech; the enspelled mirror he was meant to use had been broken when he was arrested, and he had neither messenger birds for the sending nor knowledge of a decantation that would cast his voice into his master&#x2019;s ear, even if he had access to the proper spellwine.<br><br>He had no spellwine at all.<br><br>&#x201c;Mahl says we should be able to see the shores of the next island by midday,&#x201d; Ao said. &#x201c;The map shows a village there, large enough for us to find what we need, without standing out so obviously as strangers. We can bargain for supplies there, restock, and listen for news.&#x201d;<br><br>Ao barely seemed to notice the sun&#x2019;s intensity, the copper highlights of his skin merely darkening to bronze. More annoying to Jerzy, the trader&#x2019;s natural enthusiasm, high already, increased dramatically at the thought of new people to bargain with.<br><br>Jerzy changed his mind. He didn&#x2019;t want to go overboard; he wanted to throw <i>Ao</i> overboard.<br><br>Unaware of his friend&#x2019;s emotions, or simply ignoring them, Ao clapped him on the shoulder. &#x201c;And once we discover what is what, my friend, we will be able to solve our little dilemma, and return us all home, covered in glory.&#x201d;<br><br>Home. The thought gave Jerzy an unexpected pain in his chest, like a hollow ache. Home to The Berengia. Sloping hills and low stone walls, the welcoming smell of warm earth and fruit ripening on the vine.<br><br>Home, now forbidden him, thanks to the tangled plots of Washer Darian and Sar Anton, who claimed to have caught him in the act of stealing Vineart Giordan&#x2019;s vines, and the betrayal of Giordan himself.<br><br>Jerzy could not find it in himself to blame Giordan, who had thrown Jerzy to judgment in order to save himself. Holding anger at what served no purpose; that Harvest was done, and Giordan had suffered for it, was likely dead now, for his efforts. Jerzy had Ao and Mahault to concern himself with now, and the mission that his master had set him upon.<br><br>Even now, Jerzy did not know if Sar Anton, the man who had accused both Jerzy and Giordan of breaking Sin Washer&#x2019;s Command, was part of the greater taint, or merely using the unsettled situation there to advance his own political purposes.<br><br>Jerzy&#x2019;s mission was to bring what he knew to Master Malech. Simple enough&#x2014;except that the moment he went home, the Washers would take him and possibly his master as well. If that were to happen, all hope of defending themselves against the true threat would be lost.<br><br>&#x201c;As simple as that?&#x201d; he asked Ao, returning to the matter at hand. &#x201c;Sail in, ask a few questions, discover the answer?&#x201d; Jerzy had tried that in Aleppan, and even with Ao&#x2019;s help, it had not turned out well, leaving them with more questions and no answers. &#x201c;Even if we did discover who set all this in motion, I can&#x2019;t see the Washers admitting that they were wrong, can you?&#x201d; Jerzy had learned some of politics, in Aleppan.<br><br>The trader didn&#x2019;t hesitate, shaking his head ruefully. &#x201c;No. Not without proof they could not ignore, and maybe not even then.&#x201d; The brotherhood was secure in their mission: they were Sin Washer&#x2019;s heirs and keepers of the Commands, the living barrier standing between power and abuse.<br><br>Once, Jerzy would have agreed with their role without thinking. Now ... he found himself thinking, and mostly it gave him a headache. Thinking left them here, hiding on open water, unable to return, unsure of where to go.<br><br>It was, Jerzy had quickly discovered, easier to announce he would come up with a plan than it was actually to come up with one.<br><br>&#x201c;Ha, Jerzy, Ao!&#x201d; Mahault turned just then and waved, beckoning them to join her. Walking was easier now than during his first few days, the slide of the boat on the waves and wind barely noticeable, although he kept a constant hand on the rope lines Ao had strung along the length of the boat for him to use. Mahl and Ao might dash from one side to the other like birds flitting among their birth branches, but he trusted this boat, and the sea itself, not at all. Not even when one of the sleek gray spinners that followed in their wake in the evening leaped into the air and then slid back into the waters as clearly as a hoe cut soil, or when the sun passed out of sight in the evening, leaving sparkles of red and gold in the sky and reflecting off the water. It was beautiful, but it was not <i>his</i>.<br><br>Jerzy wanted his feet flat in the warm earth again. But for now, it was safer here, on the featureless surface of the sea, where, even if he could not reach his master, neither could spells and searchers find them.<br><br>Time. It was both their ally and their enemy, but in either case, it was running out.<br><br>&#x201c;So, where is this island you promised us?&#x201d; he asked Mahault, squinting at the horizon but not seeing anything save more seemingly endless waves and large-bodied birds soaring overhead.<br><br>Unlike Ao, Mahault had patience with him. &#x201c;There, do you see?&#x201d;<br><br>Jerzy looked again, but all he saw was a hazy smudge in the distance. &#x201c;There?&#x201d;<br><br>Mahl nodded, her hands working the wheel that controlled the ship without hesitation. Her father ruled an inland city, but she claimed that she had learned to handle a ship during one of her father&#x2019;s state visits to the smaller towns along the Corguruth coast. Before he turned inward, seeing threat and plot behind every member of the Aleppan Court, and his own family. Before the magic-tainted aide had whispered in his ear and poisoned his thoughts, and shut his ears to reason.<br><br>Mahault had her own reasons to hate the source behind all this, and wish it destroyed.<br><br>&#x201c;By dusk we&#x2019;ll be there,&#x201d; Mahault reassured him, seeing only the worried crease between his brows. &#x201c;If the maps are correct, there&#x2019;s a small village where we can take on more fresh water.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And check for news,&#x201d; Ao said.<br><br>She nodded, her gaze returning to the horizon. Ao was a known harvest: he was there for the adventure, the chance to discover something new to reclaim his status within his clan. But Jerzy could not grasp Mahault&#x2019;s reasoning; she was a maiar&#x2019;s daughter, born to wealth, who had dreamed of joining the solitaires, the women soldiers, until her father forbade it. She had helped Jerzy for her own reasons, but in exile, she had neither name nor wealth to recommend her to the solitaires. He wondered what she thought when she woke each morning, and remembered. If she hated him for it, or resented their journey, she gave no sign. He did not know how long her loyalty would last, or how far she might go. He could not rely on her ... and yet he had no choice.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re steering too hard starboard,&#x201d; Ao said suddenly.<br><br>Mahl frowned and glared at him. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, you are, I can feel it.&#x201d;<br><br>Jerzy took a step back, away from the argument. Ao claimed to have spent half his life on one sort of ship or another, and the two of them had been squabbling over who should be captain since first setting foot on the ship, neither admitting the other had any skill whatsoever.<br><br>The two had been like this since their first meeting, as often hissing and spitting like cats and then laughing as though there had never been a quarrel at all. Like politics and sailing, Jerzy did not understand it. This world beyond the walls of the vintnery, outside the reach of his master&#x2019;s hand, was often too confusing, and he could feel the headache press within his skull once again.<br><br>Leaving them to their exchange of insults, Jerzy went forward to the very front of the ship, as far away from their voices as he could get, wrapping his fingers firmly around the knotted rope there. It was, Jerzy admitted as the sunlight caught on the polished wooden planks and the copper fittings, a pretty little ship. Originally made in Seicea for the <i>meme-couriers,</i> meant to carry a member of the Messenger Guild to his destination as swiftly as possible with a minimum of fuss, it could be managed&#x2014;if barely&#x2014;by a small crew. Acquiring this one thirdhand had been a stroke of luck on Ao&#x2019;s part, although he would doubtless insist it merely good trading.<br><br>The problem was they couldn&#x2019;t stay here forever, dodging from one tiny island to another, avoiding all other people for fear of being discovered and taken back to Aleppan, and the charges facing Jerzy.<br><br>The charges&#x2014;and the danger.<br><br>His throat dry, Jerzy reached for the palm-sized waterskin hanging at his belt and swallowed a scarce mouthful of tepid water, aware of how little they had left; the flat, stale taste triggered a memory he would gladly have forgotten.<br><br><i>Soil.

A chemist makes a precise prediction every time he writes a formula. The nuclear physicist advertised to the world, in the atomic bomb, how man can deal with entities so small that they are completely beyond the realm of sense perception, yet make predictions astonishing in their accuracy and significance. Economics is now reaching a point where it can hope also to make rather accurate predictions, within limits which this study will explain. Complete with more than 150 grafts and charts.

Mike Edison&#x2019;s r�sum� spans twenty years and a slew of notorious titles, including <i>Screw</i>, <i>High Times</i>, <i>Penthouse</i>, and <i>Hustler</i>. An Ivy League dropout who&#x2019;s never looked back, Edison embarked on a career that&#x2019;s landed him in the producer&#x2019;s chair for one of the worst B movies of all time; on tour with the likes of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, GG Allin, and the Ramones; undercover at a religious cult; on a bender with Evel Knievel; feuding with Hulk Hogan; smoking dope with Ozzy Osborne; and authoring some twenty novels you wouldn&#x2019;t want your mother to catch you reading&#x2014;let alone writing. As the publisher of <i>High Times</i>, he battled almost daily with a rainbow brigade of unrepentant hippies plagued with short-term memory loss, and owners who treated their employees more like the tenants of a halfway house for potheads than a team of professional editors and writers, all while leading the magazine to record heights in sales and advertising. <p></p><i>I Have Fun Everywhere I Go </i>combines the fear and loathing of Hunter Thompson&#x2019;s journalistic thrill rides with the acerbic insider voice of Toby Young. It&#x2019;s an eye-opening, gleeful view of life on the edge&#x2014;and the outlaws and oddballs encountered there.</p><p><b>Mike Edison</b> is a&nbsp;writer, editor, and musician.

That&#x2019;s the best you&#x2019;ve got?<br>If you have ever imagined a creative meeting at a magazine to be a bubbling cauldron of energy and hot ideas, with ambitious editors pitching stories and competing to get plum assignments, well, this wasn&#x2019;t it. My exhortations were greeted by grunts.<br>After years of pumping out seedy sex books and down-market filth, promoting the careers of devil-worshipping wrestlers and Bourbon Street strippers, I had finally scored my dream job&#x2014;publisher of High Times magazine. What my grandma used to call &#x201c;that dope rag.&#x201d;<br>Strangely, not everyone wants to work for a marijuana magazine, no matter how famous it is. But after years of cut-rate pornography, drugs were a definite step up.<br>There was talent in the room, but most of it had been stifled by years of stoner ennui, the unfortunate side effect of working for a pop culture perennial where free weed was a perk. One editor, whose eyes looked like hemorrhoids from years of staring down the length of a water pipe, thumbed through an old issue dispassionately. Another amused himself with a chocolate-chip cookie. The others had about as much interest in my pep rally as a monkey might have in a chess match. I should have brought them a bright red rubber ball to play with. Or a coconut. These guys knew how to make a totally excellent bong out of a coconut.<br>But the magazine was in trouble. Circulation was flagging. It seemed like they had run out of ideas. Bob Marley? He had already been the cover story. Three times. There wasn&#x2019;t a whole lot more to report.<br>When I came on board, the most recent celebrity to have been featured on the cover was Pancho Villa.<br>Pancho Villa?<br>Presumably this is why I had been hired&#x2014;to lead High Times out of the grove of hackneyed pothead icons and dead Mexican folk heroes.<br>I looked around the room and measured my team. The fellow who had been eating the cookie was covered in crumbs. Everyone looked as if they were just waiting for the bell to ring so they could go to recess.<br>This was not going to be easy.&nbsp;<br>Excerpted from I Have Fun Everywhere I Go by Mike Edison.
